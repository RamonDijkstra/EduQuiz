{"prompt": "If you win the $1.5 billion Powerball jackpot  , you may not be as lucky as you think. Many winners experience the so-called curse of the lottery, with some squandering their fortunes and others meeting tragic ends.\n\"So many of them wind up unhappy or wind up broke. People have had terrible things happen,\" said Don McNay, 56, a financial consultant to lottery winners and the author of Life Lessons from the Lottery. \"People commit suicide. People run through their money. Easy comes, easy goes. They go through divorce or people die.\"\n\"It's just a great change that they're not ready for,\" McNay told Time on Tuesday. \"It's the curse of the lottery because it made their lives worse instead of improving them.\"\nAbout 70 percent of people who suddenly receive a windfall of cash will lose it within a few years, according to the National Endowment for Financial Education. Here are some of the stories of past winners that gamblers should know about:\nAbraham Shakespeare was murdered in 2009 after he won a $30 million lottery jackpot. The 47-year-old Florida man was shot twice in the chest and then buried under a slab of concrete in a backyard, ABC News reported. Dorris \"Dee Dee\" Moore, who authorities say befriended him after his lottery win, was found guilty of first degree murder in 2012. His brother, Robert Brown, told the BBC that Shakespeare always said he regretted winning the lottery. \"'I'd have been better off going broke.' He said that to me all the time,\" Brown said.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: What can be learned about Abraham Shakespeare?\n###"}
{"prompt": "When Joan gave birth to the first boy in her family in three generations, she and her husband were overjoyed. So were her parents. Joan expected her elder sister, Sally, to be just as delighted as them. Joan had always admired Sally--the beauty and the star of the family--and felt happy about her achievements.\nBut since the baby's arrival, the sisters have become distant. Joan feels hurt for Sally seems completely uninterested in her baby. Sally, who has no children, claims that her younger sister \"acts as if no one ever had a baby before.\"\nNeither Sally nor Joan understands that the real cause of the current coldness is that their family roles have suddenly changed to the opposite. Finally Joan seems to be better than her elder sister--and Sally doesn't like it! Their distance may be temporary, but it shows that childhood competition don't fade easily as ages grow. It can remain powerful in relationships throughout life.\nIn a study of the University of Cincinnati, 65 men and women between ages 25 and 93 were asked how they felt about their brothers and sisters. Nearly 75 percent admitted having hidden competitive feelings. In a few cases, these emotions were so strong as to have affected their entire lives.\nMany adult brothers and sisters are close, supportive--yet still tend to compete. Two brothers I know turn into killers when on opposite sides of a tennis net. Off the court, they are the best of friends. My own younger sister can't wait to tell me when I've put on weight. However, she's a terrible cook and that pleases me; I tease her when she comes to dinner. Happily, despite these small failings, we have been an important resource for each other.\nIn between the very competitive and the generally supportive children lie those who say that no friendship should survive. _ .

{"prompt": "Most musicians agree that the best violins were made in Cremona, Italy, about 200 years ago. They even sound better than violins made today. Violin makers and scientists try to make instruments like the old Italian violins. But they aren't the same. Why are these old Italian violins so special? Many people think they have an answer.\nSome people think it is the age of the violins. But there is a problem here. Not all old violins sound wonderful. Only those from Cremona are special. So age cannot be the answer.\nOther people think the secret to those violins is the wood. The wood of the violin is very important. It must be from certain kinds of trees. It must not be too young or too old. Perhaps the violin makers of Cremona knew something special about wood for violins.\nBut the kind of wood may not be so important. It may be more important to cut the wood in a special way. Wood for a violin must be cut very carefully. It has to be the right size and shape. The smallest difference will change the sound of the violin. Musicians sometimes think that this is the secret of the Italians.\nSize and shape may not be the answer either. Scientists make new violins that are exactly the same size and shape. But the new violins still do not sound as good as the old one. Some scientists think the secret may be the varnish , which covers the wood of the violin and makes it look shiny. It also helps the sound of the instrument. Since no one knows what the Italian violin makers used in their varnish, no one can make the same varnish today.\nThere may never be other violins like the violins of Cremona. And there are not many of the old violins left. So these old violins are becoming more and more precious.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: What is still unclear about Cremona violins according to the writer?\n###"}
{"prompt": "The Leaning Tower of Pisa was straight like a pole when the construction began in 1173. It started to shift direction soon after construction because of poor foundation in addition to the loose layer of subsoil . At the beginning, it leaned to the southeast before the shaky foundation started to shift leaning towards the southwest. After the period of structural strengthening at the beginning of the 21stcentury, now the Leaning Tower of Pisa leans at an angle of 3.97 degrees.\nIn 1178, the shift in direction was observed for the first time when the construction had progressed further to the third floor. The tower was heavy for the three-meter foundation that was built on a weak area of land.\nFor compensating  the leaning position, the builders started to construct the upper floors with one side higher than the other one. This caused the tower to lean in the other direction. This unusual structure led to the tower being actually curved. In spite of these efforts, the tower kept on leaning.\nThe government of Italy started to plan prevention of the complete collapse of the tower in 1964. However, a request was put forward by the authorities to keep the leaning position because of the tourism industry of the region.\nAfter nearly two decades of careful planning by engineers, historians and mathematicians, the stabilization efforts for the Leaning Tower of Pisa started in 1990. The tower was closed for the general public and the people living nearby moved away. For reducing the total weight of the tower, its seven bells which represented the seven musical notes were removed. The tower was reopened for the general public on December 15, 2001.\nIn May 2008, after removing another 70 metric tons of earth, the engineers announced that the tower had been finally stabilized and it would remain stable for at least 200 years.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: Who preferred not to change the leaning position of the Leaning Tower of Pisa?\n###"}
{"prompt": "Cultural Center Adds Classes for Young Adults\nThe Allendale Cultural Center has expanded its arts program to include classes for young adults. Director Leah Martin announced Monday that beginning in September, three new classes will be offered to the Allendale community. The course titles will be Yoga for Teenagers; Hip Hop Dance: Learning the Latest Moves; and Creative Journaling for Teens: Discovering the Writer Within. The latter course will not be held at the Allendale Cultural Center but instead will meet at the Allendale Public Library.\nStaff member Tricia Cousins will teach the yoga and hip hop classes. Ms. Cousins is an accomplished choreographer   as well as an experienced dance educator. She has an MA in dance education from Teachers College, Columbia University, where she wrote a thesis on the pedagogical   effectiveness of dance education. The journaling class will be taught by Betsy Milford. Ms. Milford is the head librarian at the Allendale Public Library as well as a columnist for the professional journal Library Focus.\nThe courses are part of the Allendale Cultural Center's Project Teen, which was initiated by Leah Martin, Director of the Cultural Center. According to Martin, this project is a direct result of her efforts to make the center a more essential part of the Allendale community. Over the last several years, the number of people who have visited the cultural center for classes or events has steadily declined. Project Teen is primarily funded by a generous grant from The McGee Arts Foundation, an organization devoted to bringing arts programs to young adults. Martin oversees the Project Teen board, which consists of five board members. Two board members are students at Allendale's Brookdale High School; the other three are adults with backgrounds in education and the arts.\nThe creative journaling class will be cosponsored by Brookdale High School, and students who complete the class will be given the opportunity to publish one of their journal entries in Pulse, Brookdale's student literary magazine. Students who complete the hip hop class will be eligible to participate in the Allendale Review, an annual concert sponsored by the cultural center that features local actors, musicians, and dancers. All classes are scheduled to begin immediately following school dismissal, and transportation will be available from Brookdale High School to the Allendale Cultural Center and the Allendale Public Library. For more information about Project Teen, contact the cultural center's programming office at 988-0099 or drop by the office after June 1 to pick up a fall course catalog.

{"prompt": "Although the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Australia and New Zealand have English as an official language, the United States does not have an official language. This is why it's possible to become a US citizen without speaking English. Canada also has French as an official language, though it is mostly spoken in the province of Quebec. Because many of the English speakers who originally lived in Canada came from the US, there is little difference in American and Canadian English. Similarly, Australian English and New Zealand English have few differences, except Australia was originally settled as a penal colony   and New Zealand was not. New Zealanders were more attached to the Received Pronunciation of the upper class in England, so their dialect is considered closer to British English.\nBritish colonialism   has spread English all over the world, and it is still popular in South Africa, India, and Singapore, among other nations. In South Africa, English became an official language, along with Afrikaans and 9 African languages, in the 1996 constitution. However, only 3% of the country's 30 million people are native English speakers. Twenty percent are descendants   of Dutch farmers who speak Afrikaans, and the rest are native Africans.\nIndia became independent from Britain in 1947. However, today English and Hindi are the official languages. Indian English is characterized by treating mass nouns as count nouns, frequent use of the \"isn't it?\" tag, use of more compounds, and a different use of prepositions. In Singapore, Chinese, Malay and Indian languages all influence the form of English spoken. Everyone is taught English in the school system, but there are a few differences from British English as well. Mass nouns are treated as count nouns, \"use to\" means usually, and no articles are used before occupations.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: Why can people become a US citizen without speaking English?\n###"}
{"prompt": "English teenagers are to receive compulsory cooking lessons in schools. The idea is to encourage healthy eating to fight the country's increasing obesity rate. It's feared that basic cooking and food preparation skills are being lost as parents turn to pre-pre-pared convenience foods.\nCooking was once regarded as an important part of education in England-even if it was mainly aimed at girls. In recent decades cooking has progressively become a minor activity in schools. In  many cases the schools themselves have given up cooking meals in kitchens in the schools .But the rising level of obesity has led to a rethink about the food that children are given and the skills they should be taught.\n\"What I want is to teach young people how to do basic, simple recipes like a tomato sauce, a bolognaise, a simple curry, a stir-fry-which they can use now at home and then in their later life\", said Ed Balls, the minister responsible for schools.\nThe new lessons are due to start in September, but some schools without kitchens will be given longer to adapt. There is also likely to be a shortage of teachers with the right skills, since the trend has been to teach food technology rather than practical cooking. Also the compulsory lessons for hands on cooking will only be one hour a week for one term. But the well-known cookery writer, Pru  Leith, believes it will be worth it .\n\"If we'd done this thirty years ago we might not have the crisis we've got now about obesity and lack of knowledge about food and so on. Every child should know how to cook, not just so that they'll be healthy, but because it's a life skill which is a real pleasure\".\nThe renewed interest in cooking is primarily a response to the level of obesity in Britain which is among the highest in Europe, and according to government figures half of all Britains will be obese in 25 years if current trends are not stopped.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: In what way will cooking lessons benefit the students?\n###"}

{"prompt": "Something as simple as a smile can mean friendliness in one culture, but impatience in another. Even silence means different things in different places.\nWhen trying to communicate in a foreign language, it's natural to use gestures as a way of explaining your points.\nTapping your finger to your temple is a gesture to show memory in North America, but suggests insanity in Russia. Even nodding one's head to show \"yes\" or shaking one's head to show \"no\" can be misunderstood abroad. The yes-no gestures are different in countries like Bulgaria and Albania. In Turkey, \"no\" is gestured by nodding the head up and down.\nIt's not just individual gestures that can cause miscommunication, but the rate of gesturing can also cause miscommunication. Some countries, like Italy and Spain, are known for talking with their hands. Others use few body movements as a form of politeness. In parts of East Asia, the gesture is considered unpleasant behavior, and even rude.\nBritain, along with many countries of northern Europe and the Far East, is classed as a \"non-contact\"culture, in which there's very little physical contact in people's daily communication. Even accidentally touching someone's arm is considered rude. By comparison, in the high-contact cultures of the Middle East, Latin America, and southern Europe, physical touch is a big part of socializing.\nNaturally, these different standards of contact can lead to misunderstanding. An Argentinian may see a Scandinavian as cold, while the Scandinavian may see the Argentinian as impolite.\nIn most Western countries, frequent eye contact is a sign of confidence and attentiveness. But in many Asian, African, and Latin American countries, however, unbroken eye contact would be considered rude. These cultures tend to pay more attention to hierarchy , and avoiding eye contact is a sign of respect for bosses and elder. In these parts of the world, children won't look at an adult who is speaking to them, and nor will employees to their bosses.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: What will happen when an Argentinian meets a Scandinavian?\n###"}
{"prompt": "One evening I went out and left my 17-year-old son in charge of his 8-year-old brother and 4-year-old sister.On this occasion, the work was made less troublesome by the presence of his girlfriend.I left with complete confidence that the older children would do a wonderful job of babysitting the younger children.Later, I discovered that complete confidence was the last thing I should have left home with.\nI had decided to return home earlier than planned so that my son and his girlfriend could go out.I called home with this happy news.But instead of hearing his cheerful, grateful voice on the other end of the line, all I heard was the sound of a telephone ringing.\nIt was, I should point out, after 10 p.m.,when the two younger children should have been in bed, and when the two older children should have been answering the phone.\"I'll give him a lesson,\" I said. I decided they must be outside.Why they might be outside at 10:30 on a winter night I had no idea, but it was the only explanation I could come up with.\nFinally, in desperation, I called his girlfriend's house. After what seemed like countless rings, his girlfriend answered.\"Yes,\" she said brightly, \"He's right here.\"\nHe came on the phone.I was not my usual calm, rational self. After all, one of the rules of survival for modern parents is that you can't trust modern teenagers.\"Where are the children?\" I said.He said they were with him.They had done nothing wrong.My son had taken the younger children over to his girlfriend's house just for ice cream and cake.This was too good to be believed. Well, it turns out that I shouldn't have believed it.It was only part of the truth.\nThe following Saturday evening we were at my parents' home, celebrating my birthday.My oldest son gave me the children's gifts.Mounted and framed were a series of lovely color photographs of my children, dressed in their best clothes, and wearing their most wonderful expressions.They are pictures to treasure a lifetime, all taken by the father of my son's girlfriend.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: What might the children do that evening?\n###"}

{"prompt": "Starting a new school term is always exciting. It is a chance to see all of your friends again. But most exciting of all, the new term is an opportunity to take up new hobbies. As you know, it is common in Britain for students to take up new hobbies after the Christmas holidays. Promising to begin something new is a common New Year resolution for many school teenagers.\nMost schools offer different kinds of hobby classes. Students take them in their free periods or after school. Some classes you have to pay for and others are free of charge. For example, I once took a free Wednesday evening gymnastics class that my school offered. But when I learnt how to play the drum my parents had to pay for the lesson, and they did so, like most parents, without any complaint.\nThe most popular extra classes at my school were piano lessons and drama club:  Both classes offered exams students could take. Because the extra classes may take up much time of the students, students with many hobbies sometimes felt more stressed than those without any. But they could enjoy their life better than those who didn't foster   any hobbies at school. For example, they could build up good friendship with the persons who shared the common interest with them. Most important of all, the students with hobbies left school with many extra skills.\nFrankly speaking, I haven't continued any of the hobbies I began at school. But I have never regretted taking them. After all, my best friend today is someone whom I met in my gymnastics class. The reason why we are still keeping in close touch with each other is that we have much in common.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: What is the biggest benefit children can get from taking up a new hobby?\n###"}

{"prompt": "The Greatest Navigational Journey\nIn 1787 Captain Bligh was given command of \"The Bounty\", a three-year-old merchant ship. His mission was to transport breadfruit plants from the island of Tahiti to the West Indies. We know the popular story of this voyage and the rebellion, in which Bligh has been presented as hard, violent and thoroughly unpleasant captain. However, there is quite a lot of evidence to suggest that this picture is far from being true. He seems to have been unusually thoughtful about the health and welfare of his men. For example he made sure that his crew got exercise, insisted on cleanliness on his ship, and adopted the practice of giving them a drink which prevented scurvy every day.\nWhen Captain Bligh arrived in Tahiti, it became clear that it would be some months before the breadfruit trees were ready to be taken to the West Indies. Instead of going off right away, he gave his crew extended shore leave. This may have been a mistake as many were unhappy about leaving when the time came. Finally, on the return journey the rebellion took place. The ship was under the command of the rebels and Captain Bligh had to leave in a small boat.\nCaptain Bligh's achievement was to get to dry land successfully. It is one of the supreme examples of seamanship. Apart from Bligh there were 18 members of his crew sailing in an open boat about 23 feet long and 7 feet wide. They took with them 25 gallons of water, 150 pounds of bread and 30 pounds of pork. They had no guns or other weapons. The boat was so low in the water that it seemed likely to sink at any time. On one occasion Captain Bligh tried to land on an island to get more water. He and his men were attacked by hostile natives and one of the crew was killed. At this point Bligh decided to sail directly to the Dutch settlement on the island of Timor without stopping. The distance was about 4,000 miles.

Even though I could feel the fear, I did it anyway. Fortunately, three years later, Waiting for Jack turns out a best-seller on Amazon!\nWe all have a \"Jack\" for whom we wait--whether it's a person, a place or a thing. Now I would like to ask you: what are you waiting for?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: What might be the theme of the book Waiting for Jack?\n###"}
{"prompt": "A Japanese student called Mami told me about her own experiences in Britain. She spent 10 months in the UK last year, studying English at a language school. She really enjoyed her first two weeks in the UK. But soon she started to miss things of her own country. She found it hard to make friends,and got annoyed  about local people's behaviour.  Mami said,\"After a few weeks I started to cry a lot. I felt homesick.I thought the weather was dark and too changeable,and that affected my mood as well.\"\nTo comfort herself Mami began to spend many hours on the Internet chatting with her friends back home. She spent a couple of weeks in the countryside in Kent. She went to a social club for British people who were interested in Japan and started to make some friends there. In addition,  she took a short course in calligraphy to get an opportunity of mixing with local people. A few months later,Mami's impression of the UK had greatly changed .She found that most of the British were friendly, witty and fun.\nHowever,once Mami was back in Japan,she experienced \"culture shock\"again. She said,\"I missed the friends I had made in England. My way of thinking had changed. Sometimes I was annoyed by the views of people in my country--for example,about the value of money and time. I thought people around me lived in such a small world.\" Mami noticed some changes in her behaviour:\"I kept the habit of always carrying an umbrella with me, even on a fine day--my friends thought I was crazy!\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: Why did Mami experience culture shock in Japan?\n###"}

{"prompt": "In a recent study, participants were asked to drink beer from either a straight-sided glass, or a curved \"beer glass\". People took about almost twice as long to finish when drinking alcohol from the straight-sided glass, compared with the curved glass. There was no difference in drinking rates from the glasses when the drink was nonalcoholic.\nPeople may drink their alcohol faster from curved glasses because it is more difficult to accurately judge the halfway point of these glasses, the researchers concluded. As a result, drinkers may be less able to measure how much they have consumed. \"People often talk of 'pacing themselves' when drinking alcohol as a means of controlling levels of drunkenness, but I think the important point to take from our research is that the ability to pace effectively may be compromised when drinking from certain types of glasses,\" said study researcher Angela Attwood of the University of Bristol's School of Experimental Psychology in the United Kingdom.\nIn another experiment, participants completed a computer task in which they were shown pictures of two glasses containing varying volumes of liquid, and asked to judge whether each glass was more, or less, than half-full. The researchers found people made greater errors in judging the halfway point of the curved glass.\n\"The participants who showed the greatest error in these judgments also tended to show the greatest changes in their drinking rates,\" the researchers said. \"The speed at which people drink alcohol influences their level of intoxication  , and the number of drinks they consume on an occasion.

{"prompt": "While you may be doing everything right, ignoring just one or two steps in the process may keep you from getting a job, especially in this fierce market. Here is a checklist that covers some of the major links in the job-search chain.\nTHE RESUME --- Make sure it is up-to-date and tailored to the types of jobs you are seeking for. Have someone else look at your resume. If you cannot afford a career coach, give your resume to friends or family members to _ Have copies of your resume printed so that you are ready to hand them out at interviews.\nCOVERING LETTERS --- Maybe you've set up a few basic styles in advance, but that's not enough. Each covering letter should be designed to suit the job for which you are applying.\nTHE WARDROBE  --- Check your wardrobe to ensure that you have the appropriate professional dress, including shoes, ready for interview.\nNETWORKING --- Don't isolate yourself from others for days. Network through e-mail messages, phone calls, appointments and meetings keep you in touch with the outside world and prevent you from becoming depressed.\nAPPLICATION --- A glance at huge online job sites isn't usually the best way to find a job. You are more likely to succeed through the people you know via networking.\nTHE FOLLOW--UP --- It is quite common to apply for job and never hear back from the company. Take measures, such as following up with a phone call a week or so after you apply. If you know someone at the company, check whether that person will put in a good word for you.\nINTERVIEWS --- If you've got plenty of interviews but no return calls or job offers, take a look at your interviewing skills. This is one area where investing in a career coach may pay off. But if you can't afford one, try to find a job group or service that conducts free mock  interviews.\nSUPPORT SYSTEMS --- Finally, recognize that looking for job is rather difficult. Even at the best of times, a job hunt is often about rejection, and that can be hard to endure. Staying in touch with family, friends, professional networks and fellow job seekers can help you to maintain a positive attitude and a sense of perspective.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: What should you do if you don't receive any calls after lots of interviews?\n###"}

Soon the father arrived. Good! At least they were concerned enough to be here in time. They ignored each other.\nAs I gave a detailed account of Tommy's behavior and schoolwork, I prayed for the right words to bring these two together to help them see what they were doing to their son.

{"prompt": "You must have been troubled by when to say \"I love you\" because it is one of the greatest puzzles in our life.\nWhat if you say it first and your partner doesn't love you back? Or if they do say it but you don't feel they mean it? Being the first to declare your love can be never racking   and risky and can leave you feeling as vulnerable as a turtle with no shell. But is the person who says it first really in a position of weakness? Doesn't it pay to hold back, play it cool and wait until the other half has shown their hand faster?\n\"A really good relationship should be about being fair and being equal,\" says psychologist Sidney Crown. \"But love is seldom equal.\" \"All relationships go through power struggles but,\" he says, \"if a love imbalance continues for years, the rot will set in.\" That feeling of \"I've always loved you more\" may be subverted (,) for a time, but it never goes away completely and it often emerges in squabbling  . In love, at least, the silent, withholding type is not always the most powerful. \"The strongest one in a relationship is often the person who feels confident enough to talk about their feelings,\" says educational psychologist Ingrid Collins. Psychosexual therapist Paula Hall agrees. \"The one with the upper hand is often the person who takes the initiative.\" In fact, the person who says \"I love you\" first may also be the one who says  \"I'm bored with you' first.\" Hall believes that much depends on how \"I love you\" is said and the motivation of the person saying it. Is it said when they're drunk? Is it said before their partner flies off on holiday, and what it really means is \"Please don' t be unfaithful to me\" ? By saying \"I love you\", they are really saying \"Do you love me?\" If so, wouldn't it just be more honest to say that. Collins agrees that intention is everything. \"It's not what is said, but how it's said. What it comes down to is the sincerity of the speaker.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: What is the most important for you to consider when somebody say \"I love you\" to you?\n###"}

Simon's the expert on this. He is the only one you have to convince, and he can't hear you in the back of the room.\" That was it.

{"prompt": "The best way to come first is to go last. An analysis of almost 50 years of competitions--including Eurovision Song Contests and world skating championships--has found that contestants are more likely to win if they are among the last to appear before the judges. \n  The study by an American university appears to provide scientific proof that the best man, or woman, does not always win. \n  It found that, on average, the last competitor to appear in the Eurovision Song Contest was more than twice as likely to win as the one who went on first. \n  The first rounds of figure-skating championships, for which the running order is selected at random, showed more dramatic results. The final skater had a 14 percent chance of victory, making him or her more than four times as likely to win as the first skater. \n  The study showed a gradual _ of chances for competitors who appeared earlier in the running order. A contestant who appears first in a contest is two percent less likely to win than one who appears second. A contestant who appears second is two percent less likely to win than one who appears third, and so on.\n  The findings are published in the March issue of Acta Psychologica, a scientific journal.\n  Robert Hardman, a senior lecturer in psychology at London Metropolitan University who specializes in the science of decision-making, said that the results were interesting. He suggested that the effect was caused by the limitations of the human memory. \n  \"When people make comparisons, they aren't really able to make a lot of fine-grade discrimination. When contestants appear at the beginning of a contest, judges have little to compare them to and are perhaps wary  of the scores they give,\" he said. \n  \"Later on, when judges are able to compare the contestants to those that have gone before, they might give more extreme marks because they feel more confident about their judgments.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: What may be a problem with the judges according to the article?\n###"}

And it wasn't just the suits and changing lengths of hair the four Liverpool boys wore that had such an impact, but what they seemed to stand for. The world saw them as the voice of a new generation, one with a very different attitude to life.\n Their influence was at its height in the 1960s, but their music continues to stir listeners today. However, up until recently one aspect of the Beatles was struck in Yesterday: The music had never been remastered  . But on September 9 that situation came to an end, with the release of the entire band's music in a digital makeover. It is probably the biggest reissue   in pop music history, said British newspaper theFinancialTimes.\n The albums were remastered at Abbey Road Studios in London, the location where the band produced much of their work. The cover of their last album, AbbeyRoadof1969, featured the four young men striding   across a zebra crossing on Abbey Road itself. It is one of the most famous of all Beatles images.\n Recently, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the album, hundreds of Beatles lovers gathered there to show their appreciation.\n Pop groups come and go.

We must breathe, so we can't stay underwater for long. To explore deep water, we face even more dangers and problems.\n    A diver trying to stay underwater for a long time must breathe air or a special mixture of gases. He can wear a diving suit and have air pumped to him from above. He can carry a tank of air on his back and  breathe through a special pipe. Water weighs 800 times as much as air. Tons of water pushes against a diver deep in the sea. so his body is under great pressure. When a diver is under great pressure, his blood takes in  some of the gases he breathes. As he rises to the surface, the water pressure becomes less. If the  diver rises too quickly, the gases in his blood form bubbles .The diver is then suffering from a kind of illness. This kind of illness can cause a diver great pains and even kill him\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: Why does a diver get a kind of illness?\n###"}

Henry had to spend all his time flat on his back.\nThe men talked for hours, of their wives, families, their homes and their jobs. And every afternoon when Alan, in the bed next to the window, could sit up, he would pass the time by describing to his roommate all the things he could see. Ducks and swans played on the water while children sailed their model boats. Lovers walked arm in arm among flowers. Trees and skyline could be seen in the distance. As he described all this, Henry, on the other side of the room, would close his eyes and imagine the scene.\nOne warm afternoon Alan described a parade   passing by. Although Henry could not hear the band, he could see it in his mind. Unexpectedly, an _ though: entered his head: why should he have all the pleasure of seeing everything while I never got to see anything? It doesn't seem fair. Henry felt ashamed at first. But as the days passed and he missed seeing more sight, his envy grew and soon let him down. He began to find himself unable to sleep. He should be by that window ---- and that thought now controlled his life.\nLate one night, as he lay staring at the ceiling. Alan began to cough. He was choking. Henry watched in the dim room as the struggling man tried hard to reach for the button to call for help. Listening from across the room, he never moved, never pushed his own button which would have brought the nurse running. In less than five minutes, the coughing and choking stopped, along with the sound of breathing. Now, there was only silence ---- deathly silence.\nAs soon as it seemed appropriate, Henry asked if he could be moved next to the window. The nurse was happy to make the switch and after making sure he was comfortable, she left him alone.\nSlowly, painfully, he struggled to take his first look. Finally, he would have the joy of seeing it all himself. He looked out, but faced a black wall.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: What finally happened to Alan?\n###"}

{"prompt": "It is true that good writers rewrite and rewrite and then rewrite some more. But in order to work up the desire to rewrite, it is important to learn to like what you write at the early stage.\nI am surprised at the number of famous writers I know who say that they so dislike reading their own writing later that they even hate to look over the publishers' opinions. One reason we may dislike reading our own work is that we're often disappointed that the rich ideas in our minds seem very thin and plain when first written down. Jerry Fodor and Steven Pinker suggest that this fact may be a result of how our minds work.\nDifferent from popular belief, we do not usually think in the works and sentences of ordinary language but in symbols for ideas (known as 'mentalese' ), and writing our ideas down is an act of translation from that symbolic language. But while mentalese contains our thoughts in the form of a complex tapestry  ,writing can only be composed one thread at a time. Therefore it should not be surprising that our first attempt at expressing ideas should look so simple. It is only by repeatedly rewriting that we produce new threads and connect them to get closer to the ideas formed in our minds.\nWhen people write as if some strict critics   are looking over their shoulder, they are so worried about what this critic might say that they get stuck before they even start. Peter Elbow makes an excellent suggestion to deal with this problem. When writing we should have two different minds. At the first stage, we should see every idea, as well as the words we use to express it, as wonderful and worth putting down. It is only during rewrites that we should examine what we excitedly wrote in the first stage and check for weaknesses.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: What do people generally believe about the way human minds work?\n###"}
{"prompt": "It's never a real problem for us when the weather gets cold. We can put on more clothes, stay next to a fireplace, turn on the air conditioner or simply travel to a warmer city to spend the winter - people have many different ways of dealing with the cold.\nBut things are not as easy for plants. Unlike humans, plants can't move to escape the cold or generate heat ( ) to keep themselves warm. So how do they manage to survive the freezing winter?\nIt turns out that plants have their own strategies   too, said a study published on Dec 22 in the journal Nature.\nAccording to researcher Amy Zanne of George Washington University, US, the cold is a big challenge for plants. Their living tissues   can be damaged when they freeze. \"It's like a plant's equivalent to frostbite ( ),\" Zanne told Science Daily. Also, the process of freezing and thawing    can cause air bubbles   to form in the plant's water transport system. \"If enough of these air bubbles come together as water thaws they can block the flow of water from the roots to the leaves and kill the plant,\" she explained.\nTo live through cold weather, plants have developed three traits   , according to the study. Some plants, such as oak trees , avoid freezing damage by dropping their leaves before the winter chill sets in - effectively shutting off the flow of water between roots and leaves - and growing new leaves and water transport cells when the warm spring returns.\nOther plants, pine trees  for example, protect themselves by narrowing their water transport cells, which makes it easier for cells to travel among air bubbles.\nThe third strategy is also the most extreme - some plants die on the ground in winter and start growing as new plants from seeds when conditions get warmer.\nHowever, the study also found that these smart strategies were developed very slowly - over millions\nof years of evolution ( ). This leads scientists to worry that plants may not be able to deal with human-caused climate change, which has only started occurring over the past few decades.\nScientists are hoping that this study can help people find possible ways to save plants from the threat\nof climate change.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: What are scientists worried about when it comes to plants according to the article?\n###"}

A shark's front fins act like the wings of a plane and let it \"fly\" through the water. The tail acts like a high-power propeller .\nBut the big thing that gives the shark its edge in the ocean is its sensory package. The package includes the shark' eyes ,ears ,skin, nose and mouth, as well as electric sensing.\nA shark' nose is probably its most important sense.  If you were to put a single drop of blood in a swimming pool ,a great white shark could smell that. And they can tell the direction that the smell is coming from.\nSharks handle their electric sensing using cell located in the head .Whenever something moves using its muscles , a shark can detect the electrical impulses flowing to those muscles. A shark can electrically \"see\" anything that has muscles even if it is hiding or the water is not clear.\nSharks even have vibration sensors in their skin. Even something moves near  the shark ,tubes pick up the pressure changes and hairs inside the tubes send signals to the brain . This extra sense allows a shark to turn quickly and attack again.\nWhen you put all these different senses together ,it makes the shark a nearly ideal hunter. A shark can detect prey from miles away and then use eyes ,electrosensing and movement sensing to home in .\nStrangely, sharks do not seem to use these senses to\npeople.

{"prompt": "To many students, high school is just a basic routine. You go to class in the morning, take a break for lunch and go home in the afternoon.\nThis isn't quite that simple for pupils at Royal West Academy. As if classes and homework weren't already enough, students are also required to complete a range of extracurricular activities, or ECAs.\nThe range of ECAs being offered at the school is various, including everything from guitar and jewelry-making clubs, fund-raising marches, to student committees, swimming and tennis.\n\"I love ECAs. I'm so happy we have them,\" said grade 11 student Adrienne, who is a soccer player and member of the graduation committee. \"They motivate the students, and they're a great bonding experience. I think that without them, not half as many students would be joining up for the soccer team.\"\nRequiring students to complete ECAs is a sign of the times. That's because young people are preparing for the future in ways that weren't considered necessary before. This is an era when ECAs are seen as important. Whether it's for leadership experience, sports, craft skills or volunteer these things are seen as rounding out the individual and improving their future.\nECAs can also help students discover their likes and dislikes. But as the old song says, you can't always get what you want, especially when so many students are all trying to sign up for the most popular activities.\nECAs can cut into study and homework time if you're not careful. You really have to get organized or you'll fall apart.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: Why are ECAs important now?\n###"}
{"prompt": "Lawmakers in the United States have expanded an investigation into the use of location-tracking systems on mobile devices. The action follows recent reports about the storing of information on the Apple iPhone. Some people consider location tracking to be a threat to personal privacy and security.\nAllan Friedman, the research director, says, \"All wireless companies do some location tracking as part of their networks. This information is usually stored by the companies, not the devices, and there are laws to protect it. Law enforcement  agencies, for example, have to have a fairly high standard before it can access that data. And the phone company is also prohibited from selling that information.\nNow, two researchers report that location tracking information is being stored directly on Apple devices. They said Apple's newest operating systems gather global positioning system and timestamp information. The information is stored on the device in a file that is also uploaded   to any computer that the device is connected to. The researchers say the information is available to anyone who has access to the device or computer.\nAllan Friedman says, \"This raises additional concerns. There's the idea that because it's on my phone and on my computer, rogue applications  that I pay for or that I'm tricked into downloading may be able to access this data and somehow misuse it.\"\nApple says it is \"not tracking the location of your iPhone\". It is simply keeping a database of Wi-Fi hotspots and cell phone towers near the user's location. This information is meant to help the iPhone quickly find its location when needed.\nLetters have been sent to some of the leading mobile device developers, including Apple and Google. The letters asked for more information about their location tracking systems. Allan Friedman calls this an important start to strengthening privacy laws. He says, \"There aren't strong controls over things like location information, what they are doing with it, how long they are keeping it. And perhaps the most important question is, is my location data with other facts about me?\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: Why did American lawmakers investigate the use of location-tracking systems on cell-phones?\n###"}
{"prompt": "The first time I heard the actual London Bridge was in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, I thought it was a joke. A stupid joke at that. I mean, what sort of _ would take a perfectly good, perfectly famous bridge and move it halfway around the world to some no-name town in northwest Arizona? Back in 1962 when all this started, Lake Havasu City was nothing. A couple of shops, a couple of homes, and no tourism at all.\nIt turns out Robert McCulloch is the moron in question, and he wasn't quite the moron I thought he was. His 2.45 million dollar investment in the 130-year-old bridge--which the British government was selling because it was about to fall into the Thames--ended up being the investment of a lifetime. You see McCulloch was a real businessman, among other things, and his money paid off big. He turned Lake Havasu into one of the most visited tourist attractions in Arizona.\nIt took nine long years to take down the bridge, ship it brick by brick to the middle of nowhere, and build it up again. When it finally did open up in 1971, it was a huge deal covered by the international press.\nThe bridge is now a popular tourist attraction, and there's even a mini \"English Village\" at the foot of the bridge with souvenirs and real British food so you can have a good old time.\nNowadays Lake Havasu is a busy town with a population of about 56,000 citizens and another2.5 million visitors each year. Most of that is during spring break when the town overflows with energetic boys and girls. Even MTV and the Girls Gone Wild people get in on the action. All thanks to that little bridge.\nI don't know about you, but I'm saving my pennies. When the French get sick of that Eiffel Tower, I'll be the first to put money on it.

{"prompt": "In 1789 the prefix = st1 /U.S.government passed a law which said that the land of the American Indians could never be taken from them without their agreement. One hundred years later, however, the Indians only had a very small part of the land that originally belonged to them. How did this great injustice   occur?\nAfter 1812 white settlers began to move west across North America. At first, the settlers and the Indians lived in peace. However, the number of settlers increased greatly every year, and slowly the Indians began to see the white settlers as a danger to their survival. To feed themselves, the settlers killed more and more wild animals. The Indians, who depended on these animals for food, had to struggle against starvation. The settlers also brought with them many diseases which were common in white society, but which were new for the Indians. Great numbers of Indians became sick and died. Between 1843 and 1854 the Indian population in one area of the country went down from 100,000 to 30,000.\nMore land was needed for the increasing number of white settlers. In Washington, the old respect for the rights of the Indians disappeared. The old promises to the Indians were broken; the government began to move groups of Indians from their original homelands to other poorer parts of the country. Some Indians reacted angrily and violently to this treatment. They began to attack white settlers, and the Indian war began. For 30 years, until the late 1880s, different groups of Indians fought against the injustices of the white man. They had a few famous successes, but the result of the struggle was never in doubt. There were too many white soldiers, and they were too powerful. Many Indians were killed; the survivors were moved from their homelands to different areas of the country. It was a terrible chapter in the history of a country that promised freedom and equality to everyone.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: What is the writer's opinion about the treatment that the Indians received from the U.S.government?\n###"}
{"prompt": "What is one of the most boring and tiresome words ever? Like discipline, responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you have been a bit allergic to it. Still, it's one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life. Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works.\nIt's been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying\"It got lost\"to\"I lost it\". Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That's why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.\nMany people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.\nGeorge Bernard Shaw once said,\"People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.\"\"Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,\"said Albert Schweitzer.\nThe following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.\nThe nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.\"It's not my responsibility,\"said the nurse,\"because it's a large puddle  .\"The housekeeper didn't agree.\"Well, it's not mine,\"she said,\"the puddle is too small.\"\nThe angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.\"Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?\"he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.\nSo, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent. If you want more control over your life and the pleasures, power of freedom and independence, all you have to do is be responsible. Responsible people not only depend on themselves, but show others that they can be depended on.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: Those who escape from accepting responsibility    .\n###"}

{"prompt": "Language changes all the time. The words used by young people in the UK can be very different to those used by adults. These extremely informal words and expressions are known as \"slang\". Here are a few examples:\n*Instead of using different tag question like isn't it? Can't you or don't they? People use \"innit\".e.g. It's hot here, isn't it?=\"It's\" hot here, innit!\n*Instead of saying very, really or completely, they use \"well\". e.g. I'm well tired.\n* \"Whatever\" means \"I don't care\". e.g. A: But the teacher says we can't leave until we've finished. B:Whatever. I'm going.\nNobody uses slang and not everybody likes it. A school in Sheffield, in the north of England, recently instructed its pupils to stop using slang words. The head teacher says that if young people learn to speak 'correctly' this will help them get a good job.\nWhen British people use slang, it's no surprise that some students say they can't understand native speakers. But perhaps learners don't need to worry about communicating with native speakers so much. Research shows that most of the English spoken in the world today is spoken between non-native speakers of the language. In fact, when we think about \"International English\", there is no such thing as a native or non-native speaker.\nHow important is it to understand these slang words and expressions? If you watch films or TV, chat online in English, then understanding slang can be very useful. But you probably won't see much slang in your English exam though. With over seven billion people living on our planet today, it's easy to think one person's actions won't make a difference, however, from personal experience, I can say: each of us is capable of making a difference, however small, to someone's life.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: Based on the slang mentioned above, what is the meaning of \"I think you got me well wrong.\"?\n###"}

Vincent Van Gogh Cut Off His Entire Ear\nThis is not entirely true. It was not his entire ear - just the tip of the lobe  - and some say he didn't even do it. Van Gogh lived with artist Paul Gauguin, who had quite a violent temper, and many believe Gauguin actually did the cutting.\nEither way, Van Gogh did reportedly send the tip to a prostitute.\n3. Napoleon Bonaparte was Short\nEveryone knows Napoleon Bonaparte was a tiny man - after all, his nickname was \"le Petit Corporal.\" His reputation for being short even inspired the phenomenon known as the \"Napoleon complex.\"\nIn reality, Napoleon stood around 5 feet and 7 inches tall, which was very average back in the day. Many believe his nickname was meant as a term of endearment, not a reference to his height.\n4. Ben Franklin Preferred a Turkey to a Bald Eagle\nThe bald eagle is certainly a well-known representation of America, but legend has it that if Ben Franklin had his way, a turkey would have been much better.

Lights can help avoid shadows and create soft features on your face, so turn your face toward the main light. source. If you want to be creative, play with light angles by turning your body, but make sure the photo is properly exposed and your face is lit from the front or the side. Besides, avoid taking selfies against the main light source or with overhead lighting. Additionally, natural light possesses a warmth that makes you look like you're glowing.\nWhen taking selfies, angles also matter a lot. Hold the camera away from your face, and try to take photos both horizontally and vertically. If not, your face might look bigger than usual. Ideally, the universal selfie angle is 45 degrees above your head. But you should study your face at different angles because finding your best angle requires you having seen all of them.\nOne problem with selfies is that most have distracting backgrounds. You can always do more to show others your best side. Try to simplify the background by taking selfies outdoors or in spacious areas. Document yourself engaging in interesting activities-hiking with family members, visiting landmarks, or working out with friends. At least, you can make the photo appealing by getting rid of your outstretched arm or a background that's too busy.\nYou can also download some photo apps that allow you to adjust the lighting and contrast.

{"prompt": "The chimp didn't feel well. She fell over, ignoring the other wild chimps. Finally, the sick chimp crawled over to a bush, picked some leaves and swallowed them. By the next afternoon, the chimp was as good as new!\nBiologists watching the chimp were surprised. Somehow, the plant had cured the chimp! Did the chimp know the plant would make her feel better? Or was it just a lucky accident?\nMany scientists don't think it has anything to do with luck. They're discovering that some animals seem to use plants to cure themselves. And these animals are leading scientists to new plants that could cure humans!\nDr. Richard Wrangham, an anthropologist at Harvard University, agrees that animals may know something we don't know about forest plants.\nWrangham got to know chimps and their diets while studying them for three years in Tanzania. \"You must know a lot about an animal's feeding habits to know what it doesn't consider food,\" Wrangham explains. Every morning, he saw that most chimps ate fruit near their nests. Later on, they ate on leaves.\nWhen he noticed chimps eating the leaves of a plant they usually ignored, Wrangham thought something interesting was going on---especially when he saw that they'd sometimes walk for 20 minutes to find the plant. Another strange thing that caught his eye was how they ate the bitter leaves.\n\"They swallowed the leaves whole,\" explains Wrangham, noting that chimps usually chew their food well. \"They seemed to rub the leaves around the roofs of their mouths. They closed their eyes, wrinkled their noses and swallowed slowly. \"\nWrangham wondered what could be so good about something tasting so bad. He had a chemist analyze the leaves. He discovered that the leaves contain a red oil that kills different viruses . Later tests showed that the oil might even fight cancer and the AIDS virus!\nWhy don't the chimps chew the leaves? \"Rubbing the leaves between the tongue and the inside of the mouth might allow the chemicals to enter the bloodstream directly,\" he suggests, \"instead of going to the stomach, where they might get destroyed by acids.

{"prompt": "prefix = st1 /Wuthering Heights has a difficult narrative structure. The story begins in 1801. It is first narrated by Lockwood, a visitor staying in Thrushcross Grange, one of the two houses, where we can meet different characters in the novel. Lockwood is a narrow, dull man who is basically afraid of feeling; as a result, he is a bad man who lives emotionally through a dirty interest in the lives of others. It is this side of his character that leads into the main narrative stream of the novel. His interest in what he sees and experiences on his visits to Wuthering Heights leads him to encourage  Nelly Dean, the house-keeper at the Grange, to provide him with the information concerning the people that he has met: Heathcliff, Cathy, Hareton, Joseph and, of course, the ghost of Catherine.\nNelly Dean's story forms the major part of the narrative. While Nelly is meant to be an objective narrator, she has a lot to do with what has happened over the past twenty-five years that have led to the present state of affairs. Therefore, as readers, we need to realize how Nelly presents events and characters and her own role in determining the course of events.\nThe final part of the novel concerns the immediate future and provides us with the results of Lockwood's visit to the Heights and the appearance of Catherine's ghost. It is narrated by both Lockwood and Nelly.\nFinally, Isabella, the one time wife of Heathcliff, through a letter, narrates one middle part of the novel.\nAlthough this narrative structure may, at first, be very difficult, it is necessary because in the world of the novel, time order of the years is not so important; the events of twenty-five years ago are as much a part of the present as those in which Lockwood finds himself in 1801.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: What is special about the middle part of the novel?\n###"}

This means that every person enjoys a successful period during his or her life. To be successful, people often have to learn new skills. Yet, some people say that you can never teach an old dog new tricks. They believe that older people do not like to learn new things and will not change the way they do things.\nSome people are compared to dogs in bad ways. People who are unkind or uncaring can be described meaner than a junkyard dog. Junkyard dogs live in places where people throw away things they do not want.

Braga is proud to say she was Clements' first customer after she lost her vision.\n\"She sat me in the kitchen. It was dark, and she said ,' Are you ready?' I said, 'I'm ready.' And that is when she took this thing, and she said, ' Look and see if there is hair on the ground,' and I said ,' Yes, there is .' And she said, 'Okay, I have the right end of the thing.\" \nClements was 42 years old when she suffered a pulmonary embolism   that cost her sight. \"I was dead for 20 minutes first and then half an hour, and the lack of oxygen killed my optical  nerve.\" The last thing Clements remembered that day was the ambulance coming to get her. \"I couldn't breathe. The next thing I remembered was waking up three days later, blind, in the hospital.\"\nHer ribs had been broken, when they treated her. Her shoulder was dislocated. She had to undergo nine months of physical treatment.\n\"It was the hardest time in my life,\" she says. \"Everything changed in my life: distance, smell, and sound. My kids didn't sound the same. My husband didn't sound the same too. I didn't know my home. It took me three months to find the coffee table.\"\n Once a month, a teacher from the Virginia Center for the Blind came to her home in Woodbridge, about 40 kilometers from Washington. But Clements was eager to learn more. So in 2008, she left her husband and sons, to go to the Virginia School for the Blind in Richmond for a nine-month program. \"My plan was to be able to do for my family again, to do what I like to do, cook, clean, make phone calls.\"\n She learned basic skills like how to walk with a cane, how to listen and how to eat different foods. There were classes in Braille, computer skills and using different gadgets designed for the blind. Graduates of the program are expected to leave with not only life skills, but a marketable skill as well.\n\"My teacher asked me why I wouldn't do hair. I said, ' Hello. Blind. No, no, no.' I was scared  to think I could even do it.\"\nBut gradually, Clements gained confidence and by the time she graduated, had styled 100 heads of hair at the school. \"People from headquarters came, people from the library, students, secretaries, teachers, and friends came. Everybody came and let me do their hair,\" Clements says.\nThree days a week she leaves home to volunteer at the House of Mercy, a Catholic service organization that provides clothing, food and other support to the poor.\nKellie Ross, executive director of the House of Mercy, remembered when Clements first showed up with her friend, Kathy Braga, to offer her help.\nAt first, she had no idea Clements was blind. \"As she started to walk I realized she couldn't see, \" Ross recalls. \"She could have taken that tragic experience of losing her sight and gone inward, but instead she used that experience to help other people who are suffering.\"\nClements says she feels blessed to day, five years after her brush with death. \"I thank the Lord every day for my blindness, because I'm alive,\" she says. \"I could have been dead. I'm alive. I'm healthy, and that is what matters.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: What was Clements before she lost her sight?\n###"}
{"prompt": "Emily Post was an American writer who became famous for writing the book on correct etiquette  for social behavior in the United States. Before that, she wrote several novels and short stories which sold moderately well in the early 1900s. Then a publisher asked Ms. Post to write a book on suggested etiquette. Many people during this time had  _ through the boom in the American economy just after World War I, but these people were not raised in \"polite society\"; therefore, they did not necessarily have the proper manners. Ms. Post's book was planned to help these new upper-middle class people pass smoothly into their new social circle. She wrote the book, and it became a great success. In fact, it continued to sell well for the next 20 years. Ms. Post began writing a weekly advice column for newspapers, and the column was published in papers across the country. She even had her own radio show for several years. Ms. Post died in 1960, but her book on etiquette is still published with occasional updates under the title \"The Emily Post Book of Etiquette\". Americans continue to turn to this book for advice on the proper behaviour in a variety of social situations.\nOne area in which people in the United States can count on words of wisdom from Ms. Post is in giving gifts. Everyone has to give gifts at some time or another, and Ms. Post explains just what to do in each situation. Whether the occasion is a birthday party for a friend,  , or coworker, there are some basic rules the gift-giver and the receiver should follow.\nGiving money is a common concern among gift-givers. \"When is it proper? When is it rude? Some people see a gift of money as a sign of a gift-giver who is too lazy to go out and find a proper gift. However, this is not always the case. Sometimes money is more appreciated than a gift that the receiver does not need or cannot use. For example, elderly people who must live on a limited income may find a small gift of money as a wonderful present. For those who are uncomfortable giving cash, gift certificates to popular stores may serve as an equally acceptable gift.\nGiving flowers can be a wonderful gift for both men and women. For occasions such as funerals and dinner parties, flowers are often required. When attending a dinner party, a host or hostess may not have the time to run off and find a vase for fresh-cut flowers brought by a thoughtful guest. Bringing the flowers in a prepared vase can save the host or hostess the trouble. Flowers may also be sent ahead of time in order to give the hostess or host time to arrange and display the flowers before the party begins. If a gift of flowers seems too feminine for a man to receive, a plant is another option the gift-giver may consider.\nIn some cases, the person throwing the party may specify  that no gift is needed or wanted. It is common sense that guests should abide  by the wishes of the host or hostess. Guests who ignore the host or hostess and bring a gift may appear rude. The giving of a gift in these situations will only embarrass the host or hostess and the other guests who honored the request of no gifts. Make sure that you are not one of the rule-breakers. Be sure to follow the host's or hostess's suggestion.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: According to Ms. Post, who might appreciate money as a gift?\n###"}
{"prompt": "Researchers at the University of Bedforshire have developed a new technique for powering electronic device . The system, developed by Professor Ben Allen at the Centre for Wireless Research, uses radio waves as power.\nBelieved to be a world first, the team claims it could eventually get rid of the need for conventional batteries. The university has now applied for a patent  application to secure the only rights to the technique.\nProfessor Allen and his team have created a system to use medium wave frequencies to replace batteries in small everyday devices like clocks and remote controls.\nThe new technique uses the \"waste\" energy of radio waves and has been developed as part of the university's research into \"power harvesting\". Professor Allen said that as radio waves have energy---like light waves, sound waves or wind waves---in theory, these waves could be used to create power.\n\"The new area of power harvesting technology promises to reduce our reliance on conventional batteries,\" he said. \"It's really exciting way of taking power from sources other than what we would normally think of.\"\nThe team is now waiting for the results of the patent application to secure recognition of the technique. Professor Allen said that the team's achievements had all been done in their \"spare time\". \"Our next stage is to try and raise some real funds so that we can take this work forward and make a working pattern and maybe partner up with the right people and take this to a full product in due course,\" he said.\n\"Power harvesting has a really important part in our future, because, just in this country, we leave somewhere between 20,000 and 30,000 tons of batteries in landfill sites every single year-that is poisonous chemicals going into the ground.\"\nHe added that development of the product could also be \"commercially  beneficial\". \"The market for this is several billion pounds. We've seen market predictions for 2020 which have these kinds of figures, so there's a lot of commercial potential in this area,\" he said.\nPro-Vice Chancellor at the University of Bedfordshire, Professor Carsten Maple said, \"This type of work is a reflection of the university's growing reputation and experience in carrying out creating research.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: What is Professor Carsten Maple's attitude toward the new technique?\n###"}

{"prompt": "Before a new type airplane goes service, every part of it is tested again and again. But there are two tests that are more of into important than the others.\nThe first is called the \"tank test\". A modern airplane must fly very high in the sky. Air must be pumped into the plane so that the passengers can breathe. The metal structure of the plane has to be very strong for this reason. When the plane is filled with air, the air presses against the skin of the plane inside. The pressure on a small window is like a huge foot that is trying to get out. If a small part of the plane were to fail, the plane would explode in the sky. To test the structure of the plane, the plane is lowered into a huge tank or container of water. Then it is filled with air. The pressure inside the plane is greater than it ever will be when it is high up in the air. Finally, there is an explosion. This does not cause so much damage inside the water tank as it would anywhere else. Engineers can discover which part of the plane has broken. Then that part is made stronger.\nThe most dangerous test happens when the new plane is going through test flights in the air. The test must find out exactly what happens when the engines  are all shut off at once. The plane begins to fall like a stone. It is the pilot's job to find out how he can get control of the plane again.

{"prompt": "Almost every machine with moving parts has wheels,yet no one knows exactly when the first wheel was invented or what it was used for.We do know,however,that they existed over 5,500 years ago in ancient Asia.\nThe oldest known transport wheel was discovered in 2002 in Slovenia.It is over 5,100 years old.Evidence suggests that wheels for transport didn't become popular for a while,though.This could be because animals did a perfectly good job of carrying farming tools and humans around.\nBut it could also be because of a difficult situation.While wheels need to roll on smooth surfaces,roads with smooth surfaces weren't going to be constructed until there was plenty of demand for them.Eventually,road surfaces did become smoother,but this difficult situation appeared again a few centuries later.There had been no important changes in wheel and vehicle design before the arrival of modern road design.\nIn the mid1700s,a Frenchman came up with a new design of road--a base layer  of large stones covered with a thin layer of smaller stones.A Scotsman improved on this design in the 1820s and a strong,lasting road surface became a reality.At around the same time,metal hubs (the central part of a wheel)came into being,followed by the pneumatic tyre  in 1846.Alloy wheels were invented in 1967,sixty years after the appearance of tarmacked roads .As wheel design took off,vehicles got faster and faster.

{"prompt": "Now scientists believe that global warming affects hibernating animals, causing them to wake up earlier. While this may seem a little concern, it is in fact a serious environmental problem. The shortened hibernation period could actually lead to significant decreases in the population of several species.\nSome of the first evidence of the problem came from Colorado, where researchers at the Rocky Mountain Biological Lab have been observing marmot   hibernation behavior since the 1970s. In the early days of their studies, marmots generally hibernated several weeks into the month of May. Nowadays, however, temperatures in the area have risen by 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit, and the marmots wake up about a month earlier.\nAt least the marmots are still hibernating. Several other animals have not been hibernating at all recently. Brown bears in the Spanish Cantabrian Mountains did not hibernate last year. Chipmunks   in the US and some snakes in Australia also skipped the hibernation period. The bears seem to have survived without losing many individuals. The chipmunks and snakes, however, were not so lucky. Many of the animals died of starvation during the winter.\nThe problem with animals waking up early, or skipping hibernation altogether, lies with the creatures' metabolism  . When the animals hibernate, their metabolism drops significantly. The animals' heart rate slows, and they require very little energy to live. When the animals awake in the spring, their metabolism returns to normal.\nBut while their metabolism may be as active as it was before hibernation, food sources aren't as available as they were before. A marmot may wake up when temperatures get warmer, thinking it's spring, but plants will not have got the amount of sun they need to grow. So until the plants grow, the marmots have no reliable food source.\nMany scientists believe the problem will continue to get worse. For many biologists, that's a scary prospect.

{"prompt": "The man with the bullhorn encouraged the runners as they made their way up the hill. \"Two hours, fifteen minutes, forty seconds ...\"His deep, loud voice boomed toward us.\nIt was mile 17 of the marathon.\n\"Hey, great stride!\" a bearded viewer yelled to me. He clapped loudly. \"You're looking strong. Keep going--go, go, go!\"\nYou bet I'm looking strong, I thought, as I followed my younger sister, Laura. I just got started. She had been diligently clocking eight-minute miles since the race had begun downtown. Initially in the middle of a pack, which was several thousand people, she had been steadily passing other runners for the past 10 miles or so. We were now on the relatively steep rise to the St. Cecelia Bridge. Once we crossed, we would begin heading back into town, running along the east side of the Rincon River. Laura had asked me to run the most difficult section of the marathon with her. Not having trained for anything more challenging than a quick walk, and with no experience running in organized events, I figured I might be good for two or three miles.\nUp ahead, steel drums were playing. A group of drummers was beating their drums, chanting, and encouraging us with their music and smiles. Crossing the bridge, I recalled the advice in the Marathon Handbook. During my preview of the route, it had seemed like a babyish thing to do. But now it seemed like a fine idea, and I spat magnificently over the side of the bridge.\n\"I read the handbook, too!\" said a woman behind me, who also let loose over the side of the bridge. We had now started a chain reaction of bridge spitters. It was quite a sight, but I had other things to occupy my attention, namely the back of Laura's sweater.\nEasing off the bridge, and heading south on Avila Boulevard, Laura and I found our pace together again. Here we could hang to the left of the group and enjoy some brief conversation. \"You keeping up okay?\" she asked. Being her older brother, and therefore unable to admit weakness, I nodded convincingly.\n\"Hey, Lee!\" yelled a waving man on the sidewalk. Immediately pleased that my marathon efforts had been recognized by someone I knew, I waved back and reflected on the importance of wearing tie-dyed clothing to a road race of this size. It made it a lot easier to be spotted!\nThe town marathon is a \"people's\" marathon in that it tends to be a family affair, with the runners and spectators creating a festival atmosphere. I managed to run six miles before bowing out, and Laura finished the entire race in under four hours. I now pride myself on telling people that I ran in a marathon. The distinction between having run a marathon and having run in a marathon seems unimportant. If pressed, however, I'll admit that I only ran one-fourth of one.\nInspired by this year's experience, I plan to walk the course--really fast--next year. It's not because I'm jealous of my sister's accomplishment. This is not some silly competition in which I must do whatever she does. Rather, Laura got free cookies at the finish line, and the promise of that will lead me to any goal.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: Why was Lee glad he wore a tie-dyed shirt?\n###"}
{"prompt": "Do you know of anyone who uses the truth to deceive   ? When someone tells you something that is true, but leaves out important information that should be included, he can give you a false picture.\nFor example , some might say, \"I just won a hundred dollars on the lottery   . It was great. Itook that dollar ticket back to the store and turned it in for one hundred dollars! \"\nThis guy is a winner , right?  Maybe , maybe not. We then discover that he bought  $200 worth oftickets, and only one was a winner. He's really a big loser!\nHe didn't say anything that was false, but he left out important information on purpose. That's called a half-truth. Half-truths are not technically lies, but they are just as dishonest.\nSome politicians often use this trick. Let's say that during Governor Smith's last term, her state lostone million jobs and gained three million jobs. Then she seeks another term. One of her opponents says, \" During Governor Smith's term, the state lost one million jobs !\" That's true. However, anhonest statement would have been , \"During Governor Smith's term, the state had a net gain of two million jobs. \"\nAdvertisers will sometimes use half-truths. It's against the law to make false statements, so they try to mislead you with the truth. An advertisement might say, \"Nine out of ten doctors advised their patients to take Yucky Pills to cure toothache.\" It fails to mention that they only asked ten doctors and nine of them work for the Yucky Company.\nThis kind of deception happens too often. It's a sad fact of life: Lies are lies, and sometimes the truthcan lie as well.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: How many examples does the writer give to show how the truth is used to deceive?\n###"}

{"prompt": "As early as 1894, the newly-formed International Olympic Committee (IOC) considered ice skating as a possibility for the first modern Olympic Games which would be held in 1896.\nIn 1911, a member of the IOC suggested that winter sports should be staged as part of the 1912 Olympics in Helsinki. Some were against the idea. At last, the IOC decided to hold Winter Olympic Games in 1916. However, World War I broke out in 1914. After 1920, the national governing bodies for winter sports in several countries began talking about the possibility of a separate Winter Olympics.\nThe town of Chamonix, in the French Alps, planned to hold a winter sports festival in 1924, at the same time Paris was to host the Olympics. The Marquis de Polignac, a member of the IOC, suggested that the festival be formally recognized as the Winter Olympic Games. The IOC didn't go that far, but did agree that Chamonix could call its festival an \"Olympic winter carnival\".\nThe festival drew 258 athletes from 16 countries to compete in bobsledding , figure skating, hockey, Nordic skiing and speed skating. Charles Jewtraw from the United States won the first gold medal, in the 500-meter speed skating, but the festival's hero was Claus Thunberg from Finland. He won five medals, three of which were gold, in speed skating.\nWeather has often been a major story at the Winter Olympics, and so it was at Chamonix. The festival opened with rain and unseasonably warm temperature that turned snow and ice to mud. Then temperature dropped as far as 25 below zero and the mud became ice.\nDespite  the weather, more than 10,000 people showed up.

{"prompt": "A few months ago as I wandered through my parents' house, the same house I grew up in, I had a sudden, scary realization. When my parents bought the house, in 1982, they were only two years older than I am now. I tried to imagine myself in two years, ready to settle down and buy the house I'd still be living in almost 30 years later.\n    It seemed ridiculous. On a practical level, there's no way I could afford to buy a house anytime soon. More importantly, I wouldn't want to. I'm not sure where I'll be living in two years, or what kind of job I'll have. And I don't think I'll be ready to settle down and stay in one place.\n    So this is probably the generation gap that divides my friends and me from our parents. When our parents were our age, they'd gotten their education, chosen a career, and were starting to settle into responsible adult lives.\n    My friends and I - \"Generation Y\" - still aren't sure what we want to do with our lives. Whatever we end up doing, we want to make sure we're happy doing it. We'd rather take risks first, try out different jobs, and move from one city to another until we find our favorite place. We'd rather spend our money on travel than put it in a savings account.\n    This casual attitude toward responsibility has caused some critics to call my generation \"arrogant\", \"impatient\", and \"overprotected\". Some of these complaints have a point. As children ,we were encouraged to succeed in school, but also to have fun. We grew up in a world full of technological innovation: cellphones, the Internet, instant messaging, and video games.\n    Our parents looked to rise vertically --starting at the bottom of the ladder and slowly making their way to the top, on the same track, often for the same company. That doesn't apply to my generation.\n    Because of that, it may take us longer than our parents to arrive at responsible, stable adulthood. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. In our desire to find satisfaction, we will work harder, strive for ways to keep life interesting, and gain a broader set of experiences and knowledge than our parents' generation did.  \nBy Ariel Lewiton\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: What can we conclude from the article?\n###"}

He could, for instance, remember which brand of tea Mrs. Smith usually bought or what sort of washing-powder Mrs. Jones preferred.

{"prompt": "In 1993, New York State ordered stores to charge money on beverage   containers. Within a year, consumers had returned millions of aluminum cans and glass and plastic bottles. Plenty of companies were eager to accept the aluminum and glass as raw material for new products, but because few could figure out what to do with the plastic, much of it wound end up buried in landfills  . The problem was not limited to New York. Unfortunately, there were too few uses for second-hand plastic.\nToday, one out of five plastic soda bottles is recycled in the United States. The reason for the change is that now there are dozens of companies across the country buying discarded   plastic soda bottles and turning them into fence post, paint brushes, etc.\nAs the New York experience shows, recycling involves more than simply separating valuable materials from the rest of the rubbish. A discard remains a discard until somebody figures out how to give it a second life -- and until economic arrangements exist to give that second life value. Without enough markets to take in materials collected for recycling, throwaways actually reduce prices for used materials.\nFewer landfill space and rising costs for burying and burning rubbish are forcing local governments to look more closely at recycling. In many areas, the East Coast especially, recycling is already the least expensive waste-management choice. For every ton of waste recycled, a city avoids paying for its disposal (,), which, in parts of New York, amounts to savings of more than $100 per ton. Recycling also stimulates the local economy by creating jobs and reduces the pollution control and energy costs of industries that make recycled products by giving them a better raw material.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: What regulation was issued by New York State concerning beverage containers?\n###"}

{"prompt": "Kids are cool to wear blue jeans and T-shirts today. It is fashionable like that. Fashion refers to the styles of dress that are currently popular. Fashion goes beyond just clothes, though. It's important for some people to wear only the latest fashions and styles. For others, though, keeping up with trends isn't that important. The one thing that stays the same with fashion is this: it always changes!\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, Hippies made bell--bottomed blue jeans popular. Also, in the 1980s, Michael Jackson made parachute pants all the fashion. Now try to find these items in today's clothing stores!\nDo you know why fashions change?The answer is probably as simple as the fact that people change. Over time, the new replaces the old. People are influenced greatly by popular culture, including athletes, musicians, movies stars, as well as popular films, television shows, books and music. We are also influenced by the fashion industry's advertising.\nThe stars of popular culture are always searching for a new angle to maintain their popularity. Often these new angles come in the form of new clothing or hairstyles. When people see these new styles, they often want to imitate  their favorite stars. To do so, they seek out the latest fashions to make themselves look like the people they want to imitate. In this way, fashions evolve and change over time.\nClothes have been used to separate people into groups for many years. Even today, brand-name, clothing that is more expensive than other types of clothing can be used by some people to make themselves different from others.\nUnfortunately, this can often have the effect of distancing certain groups from others. Don't forget that it's always OK to develop your own sense of style that is unique and separate from what the fashion world determines! Stay true to yourself and let your personality -- not your clothes -- speak for who you are!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: What causes the changes of fashions?\n###"}
{"prompt": "With large and small keyboards everywhere, neither children nor adults need to write much of anything by hand. That's a big problem. Study after study suggests that handwriting is important for brain development -- helping kids get fine motor skills and learn to express and create ideas. Yet the time devoted to teaching penmanship in most schools has shrunk to just one hour a week. Is it time to give up handwriting? Have a look at the link between the brain and penmanship, and you may get the answer.\nA test among students in grades 2, 4 and 6 found that they not only wrote faster by hand than by keyboard, but also created more ideas when composing essays with handwriting. And other research shows that the finger movements required to write by hand activate brain areas involved with thought, language, and short-term memory.\nA recent Indiana University study had one group of children practice writing letters by hand while a second group just looked at those letters. Then, both groups of kids entered a functional MRI   that scanned their brains as the researchers showed them the same letters. Researchers found that the brain activity in the first group was far more advanced and \"adult-like\".\nHandwriting also affects other people's way they think of adults and children. Several studies have shown that the same average essay will score much higher if written with good penmanship and much lower if written out in poor handwriting. These studies have also found that people judge the quality of a person's ideas based on his or her handwriting. And the consequences are real: On standardized tests with handwritten sections, like the SAT, all essay that is considered hard to recognize gets a big zero.\nStudies show that this isn't only an English-language phenomenon. Chinese and Japanese youths are suffering from \"character amnesia\". They can't remember how to write characters, thanks to computers and text messaging. Some experts fear that Chinese writing and reading are so closely linked in the brain that China's reading ability as a nation could suffer.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: What does the Indiana University study imply?\n###"}

Before today, we have always stood by his side, told the hairdresser what to do and watched over the whole thing.

Today, he got one of those rewards by having his own haircut.\nWhen they arrived at the shop, his father showed him a book with lots of styles of haircuts for boys. After he made his choice, he waited patiently for his turn. My husband decided he would get his own hair cut at the same time.\nWhen their names were called, Kevin showed the hairdresser the picture of his chosen haircut, which, thankfully, was not a strange haircut. The hairdresser looked to my husband for approval   and he told her his son was in charge.\nDuring his haircut, Kevin talked happily with the hairdresser.

Father and son are on their way to the barbershop, something they have always done together.\nAlways, the routine is the same. \"It's about time we got that mop of yours cut,\" David's dad will say, pointing at him with two fingers, a cigarette caught between them. \"Perhaps I should do it.

{"prompt": "The movies just wouldn't be the same without the warm buttery taste of popcorn. Amazingly, this delicious treat started its life as a corn kernel   , not just from any corn. Popcorn is a type of sweet corn that was originally grown in Mexico and spread to China, India and elsewhere. It is the only kind of corn that will pop. Today, most of the world's popcorn is grown in the United States.\nEvery popcorn kernel contains a tiny drop of water,surrounded by soft starch  .  When the popcorn is heated, the water turns into steam. This puts pressure on the surrounding hard kernel, forcing it to explode. The soft starch increases about 40 times in size as the corn kernel turns itself inside out.\nIn the 1500s popcorn was an important food source for the Aztec Indians of central and southern Mexico.  But it wasn't only food. It was also used in ceremonies or on red dresses and in necklaces. By the time the Europeans arrived in America,popcorn had spread through most of the American Indians.\nSome early American settlers ate popcorn with cream and sugar for breakfast. But it wasn't until the late 1800s that popcorn became popular. The demand for popcorn increased and farmers began farming popcorn. The first mobile popping machine was invented in 1885, and popcorn was sold by street sellers much like hot dogs that are sold today.\nDuring the Great Depression of the 1930s, the popcorn business still _ as people could still afford it. Then in the 1950s television arrived and popcorn consumption decreased. People stayed home and stopped going to the theatre. But the link between movies and popcorn had already existed.  Soon people began making popcorn at home on the stove and, later,microwave popcorn was introduced. Today the movies have regained popularity and popcorn has once again become the favorite.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: Why does the corn kernel pop when heated?\n###"}

Ali Mountain is world famous for its \"five rare sites\" including the Sunrise, the Ali Mountain Forest Railway, the famous Alishan Sacred Tree, the Grand Sea of Clouds, and the Flamboyant Cherry Blossom. It is said that one who has not been to Ali Mountain will never know its wonderful beauty. \nThe sunrise is a must for everyone who travels the Ali Mountain. Many have said, \"To miss viewing the sunrise on Ali Mountain is like returning empty after entering the Golconda, a source of great wealth.\" The best place to view the sunrise is on the top of Zhu Hill. The place and time of the sunrise are different due to the changes of the four seasons. If you plan to view the sunrise, it is best to ask the local people the time of sunrise, so you don't miss this magnificent opportunity. \nThe Ali Mountain Forest Railway is regarded as one of three mountain climbing railways. Traveling along the 72-kilometer-long railway, the train climbs from 30 meters (about 98 feet) to 2,450 meters (about 8,038 feet) above sea level. Its gradient is so great that it is rarely seen in the whole world. From the bottom of Ali Mountain to the top, the train crosses four forest areas--tropical, subtropical, temperate and frigid zones. \nThere is a Chinese juniper   within the Ali Mountain forest area, with some 53 meters (about 174 feet) high, and 23 meters (about 75 feet) wide. This juniper is so huge that more than ten people can surround it. It has a history of more than 3,000 years, thus is called Alishan Sacred Tree. The most wondrous tree is a \"three-generation\" tree. The three generations of this tree exist in the same trunk. While the first and second generations have faded, the third generation is still flourishing. This tree is really a wonder of nature.\nThe sea of clouds and the cherry blossom should not be overlooked.

But the small dot on the world map has since developed into one of the richest nations thanks to its founder and first Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, the father of the state, who passed away on March 23, 2015 at the age of 91.\nLee grew up in a Singapore that was part of the British Empire. As a law major who graduated from Cambridge University and the founder of the People's Action Party, he became Singapore's first prime minister in 1959 when British agreed to the island's self-rule.\nLee was a leader with vision . He knew that without agriculture and natural resources, Singapore could only find a way out by developing itself into a place perfect for business. So he began with a few simple ideas: Singapore needed respect for elders and the law, hard work, and the idea that the needs of society are greater than the individual's. He united Chinese, Indians and Malays, making English a common language. He fought corruption and even banned chewing gum. That helped change Singapore from a poor city in the 1950s to a world business center with a GDP per-capita of $ 55,000, reported the Financial Times.\nLee left the office of prime minister in 1990 but remained a member of parliament. He resigned as \"Minister Mentor\" in 2011. He was happy with his work: \"I have no regrets. I have spent my life, so much of it, building up this country. There's nothing more that I need to do.\"\nTo the world, Lee was one of Asia's most popular politicians. He was one of the first to spot the potential of China under a former leader Deng Xiaoping and contributed to China's reform and opening up. \"No small number of this and past generations of world leaders have asked for his advice on governances and development,\" said US President Obama. \"Lee is a visionary and a true giant of history.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: How long did Lee Kuan Yew serve as Singapore's prime minister?\n###"}

He never did learn to walk, but he did learn to talk  --not even in complete sentences, but he had the basics down. If he was hungry, thirsty, happy or sad, we knew. He knew names too.

The only time I thought of the differences between us was when others pointed them out. \nMy circle of friends widened when I entered high school. One day Mom asked if my new friends would have a problem seeing Mike for the first time. \"If they don't accept Mike, they don't accept me and they aren't welcome,\" I said.\nAnd if I didn't think of him as different, I never thought about him dying either.

Michael Patrick Harter--just 26 years old-- died in Mom's arms. \nWe never had those great talks other brothers have about women, work and parents. We never played catch or talked about our dreams. But Mike taught me compassion and strength. He taught me respect for those less fortunate than myself.

{"prompt": "Poverty is not first thing that comes to mind when you think of Japan. After all, there are no children begging on the streets in major cities here. You do not often see Japanese citizens publicly letting out their complaints over the country's economic decline. But senior government researcher Aya Abe says Japan has the fourth highest rate of child poverty among developed countries.\nShe says she sees that poverty in schools where students admit to only bathing once a week. Some cannot afford to buy pencils for class.\n\"They may not be on the streets begging or they may not be turning into criminals, but it's there. It's just that we have to open our eyes and see,\" Abe said.\nAbe owes the increase in child poverty to the country's changing demographics , struggling economy and high social security premiums . She says fewer people live in three-generation households, where the parents and grandparents work. The number of single mothers has increased. The salary for young fathers has declined with the economic downturn. Social security premiums have increased in the last 20 years, putting families on the edge of poverty.\nAbe says studies conducted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD ) point to rising poverty in Japan before the global economic crises in 2008. But the Japanese government and the public refused to acknowledge it until then partly because of the shame associated with poverty.\n\"It was very unpopular for Japanese media to say anything about Japanese poverty,\" said Abe. \"Even though OECD Japan announced it in Japanese, Japanese media didn't make it into the articles.\"\nAbe says new Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama has taken one important step to help alleviate   the problem. Next year, his Democratic Party of Japan plans to double monthly child care allowances given to families.\nBut Abe wants the government to expand its financial help even more. She wants it to simplify the process to apply for public assistance and provide educational grants for students struggling to pay for tuition at high schools and colleges. The country now only offers loans.\nAbe also says the government must act quickly because she says the problem will only get worse in the next few years.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: Why was it unpopular for Japanese media to say anything about Japanese poverty?\n###"}

{"prompt": "On the high-speed train Avignon to Paris, my husband and I landed in the only remaining seats on the train, in the middle of a car, directly opposite a Frenchwoman of middle years. It was an extremely uncomfortable arrangement to be looking straight into the eyes of a stranger. My husband and I pulled out books. The woman produced a large makeup case and made up her face. Except for a lunch break, she continued this activity for the entire three-hour trip. Every once in a while she surveyed the car with a bright-eyed glance, but never once did she catch my eye. _ .\nI was amused, but some people would have felt uncomfortable , even repulsed .there is something about making up in public that calls up strong emotional reactions. Partly it's a question of hygiene. And it's a matter of degree. Making up --- a private act--- has a way of neglecting the presence of others. I was once seated at a party with a model-actress who immediately waved a silly brush and began dusting her face at the table, demonstrating that while she was next to me, she was not with me.\nIn fact, I am generally prohibited from making up in public, except when I am in the company of cosmetics moment. In a gathering more professional than social, I would do so.\nKathy Peiss, a history professor at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst says that nose-powdering in the office was an occasion for outrage in 1920's and 30's. Deploring the practice as a waste of company time, trade journals advises managers to discourage it among workers. Peiss theorizes that it was female's making up in what has been an all-male field that disturb some gentlemen.\nPeiss tells me that after the 30's , pulling out a make-up case was no longer an issue. It became an accepted practice. I asked if she feels free to apply lipstick at a professional lunch herself. Sounding mildly shocked, she says she would save that for the privacy of her car afterward. Why? Because it would be \"a gesture of inappropriate feminity .\" One guess is that most professional women feel this way.

Where can kids go for a snack?\nThere is not a single restaurant in Brockingham where a family of four can eat dinner for less than $100. Add a 15% tip and sales tax and you have spent nearly $125 to eat a meal you could prepare at home for about $12. Have you noticed that Brockingham families never dine in Brockingham?\nFast-food restaurants are also a good place for school kids to get an after-school job. Fast-food restaurants are busiest during the early supper hours when students are able to work, whereas the fancy food restaurants cater to late-night diners. Working in one of these establishments requires working shifts that are too late for most students.\nThe City Council claims that local merchants, rather than national chains, should benefit from the tourist business. I agree that it is important to support local businesses, but I think the fast-food restaurants would encourage more people to shop in Brockingham.\nAnother thing that disturbs me is that we must travel 25 miles to the nearest discount store.

The park is one of the few areas in Europe to hold the council's diploma for nature reserves of the highest quality, and Dr Baum had come to present it to the park once again. He was afraid that public opinion was turning against national parks, and that those set up in the 1960s and 1970s could not be set up today.

The shortsighted view that reserves had to serve immediate human demands for outdoor recreation should be replaced by full acceptance of their importance as places to preserve nature for the future.\n\"We forget that they are the guarantee   of life systems, on which any built-up area depends,\" Dr Baum went on. \"We could manage without most industrial products, but we could not manage without nature.

Clothing, hairstyles, attitudes and even the language are all gained by some amount of influence, whether it is from commercials, fashion, trends, celebrities or music. Teens and preteen children are influenced by these various factors. However, a child's friends are the No. 1 influence.\nBefore you think your children's friends could never lead one another astray  , think again. A child may experience an event that has caused overwhelming stress or may have problems at home or school, which causes negative behavior. Negative influences of a child's friends can come without warning.\n\"Parents who ask their children where they are going, who they are going with and request a meeting with their children's friends and the friends' parents have already taken the first step,\" says Mara Berkley, family therapist and professor at Bristol University in Rhode Island.\nLynn Rexroat of Chillicothe, Illinois, uses this method to _ her children. \"My oldest son knows that in order for him to go anywhere with a friend, especially one I haven't met before, I have to speak with that friend's parent to make sure the arrangements are agreeable with us both,\" she says. \"I don't interrogate   them by asking about their private life. I just want to know that the parents of the other child know what the boys are planning to do. I feel that by my wanting to know I am protecting my son.\"\nWhen a parent suspects that their child is hanging out with \"the wrong crowd\", the last thing on their mind should be discipline. Instead, Berkley says a parent should be more interested in finding out the reasons behind the behaviors and the child's choice to keep company with these types of friends.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: How does Lynn Rexroat protect her son according to the text?\n###"}
{"prompt": "Taking a shower is relaxing. You can hum a song, daydream or think about nothing, leaving the real world behind you. But did you know that showering can also benefit your mind?\nA research by Scott Barry Kaufman, a psychologist from Yale University in the US interviewed over 3,000 people around the world. It turned out that nearly two-thirds of the interviewees said they had experienced new ideas in the shower and were more likely to have them in the shower than at work.\nSo why does a simple shower have such magic power? Science can explain it.\nShowering can help to raise our level of dopamine, a hormone   closely related to our creativity. \"People vary in terms of their level of creativity according to the activity of dopamine\", explained Alice Flaherty, a famous American neuroscientist. \"Taking a warm shower can make us feel relaxed and therefore make the dopamine level rise and bring 'Aha!' moment to us.\"\nBesides the chemical changes, showering may give you a break from what you feel you have been stuck with. Especially when you have thought hard all day about a problem, jumping into the shower can keep you from the outside world so that you can focus on your inner feelings and memories. In this way, according to American psychologist Shelley H. Carson, author ofYour Creative Brain, \"a showering hour may turn into an 'incubation   period' for your ideas.\"\nCompared with sitting in front of a computer, taking a shower is something we do less frequently in our daily life. When showering, we get a fresh experience with the change of location, temperature and humidity. \"New and unexpected experiences can lead to positive changes in thinking,\" explained Kaufman. \"Getting off the couch and jumping in the shower may create a distance and force you to think from a new point of view.\"\nShowering allows us to enjoy the creative juices of our minds, but it needn't just be the bathroom where you get your inspiration. For instance, Gertrude Stein, a female American writer and poet, got new ideas by driving around a farm and stopping at different cows until she found the one that most inspired her. So try to create your own way to free your mind, whether it's a walk near the ocean, a country drive or reading a book at home.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: According to the article, what changes can showering cause?\n###"}

They were questioned about their use of several kinds of drugs and alcohol. The teenagers also filled in questionnaires about their relationship with their parents and grandparents, how well they were supervised   after school and whether they were allowed to meet friends at home.\n\"Both the quality of family relationships and the structure of families have significant influences on youth drug use,\" McArdle said in a statement. But he added a strong maternal bond offered the greatest protection against developing drug habits.\nThe rate of drug abuse among teenagers living with both parents and who bad a good relationship with their mother was 16.6 percent. If either factor was missing the drug abuse rate rose to 32 percent. More than 42 percent of teenagers living in one parent families who did not have a strong bond with their mother used drugs.\nDrug prevention campaigns in British schools and on television warn teenagers about the danger of drugs and alcohol but McArdle said no one is undertaking the issue of their parents' responsibility.\n(http://edu.china.com/zh _ cn/elearn/english/news/512/20020516/11254954.html)\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: According to McArdle, which is most likely to have the drug abuse problem?\n###"}

{"prompt": "ANIMALS have always been used to represent certain human characteristics. Countries also use animals as symbols. From eagles to lions, many countries use an animal to show its national spirit and character.\nThe image of an eagle is on the US President's flag, and on the one-dollar bill. The bald eagle is a large, powerful, brown bird with a white head and tail. The term \"bald\" does not mean that this bird lacks feathers. Instead, it comes from the old word piebald, that menas, \"marked with white\".\nThe US declared that the eagle was its national bird in 1782. It was chosen because of \"its long life, great strength, and noble looks\".\nA few eagles have even become American heroes. An eagle named \"Old Abe\", the mascot of a Wisconsin troop of soldiers during the Civil War, traveled 14,000 miles with its men. He was often shot at by the enemy, but survived 42 battles.\nBut, one of the Founding Fathers, Benjamin Franklin didn't agree with the choice. \"The bald eagle ... is a bird of bad moral character, like those among men who live by robbing, he is generally poor, and often very messy,\" he argued. Franklin wanted the turkey as the country's national bird.\nIf Americans chose their national symbol deliberately, the symbol of England arose out of history.\nKing Herry I(1068-1135) was a brave warrior but also wise. His appreciation for the rule of law earned him the nickname the Lion of Justice. He was the first English King to use a lion as a royal symbol, which is popularly known as the \"king of the jungle\". By the year Richard I, known as \"The Lionheart\" for his bravery, came to the throne in 1189, the famous Three Lions badge had been formed. Now it can be seen on the shirts of England's sports teams.\nAlthough people might not think of lions when they think of England, everyone knows about the Australian kangaroo. Legend has it that the kangaroo gets its name from an early meeting between local aborigines and white settlers. When asked by the Europeans what these strange-looking animals were, a native replied \"kangaroo\", meaning \"I don't understand you.\"\nThe kangaroo is an individualistic animal. Although it does gather in groups, the kangaroo is not a herd animal. If a group is attacked, individuals run off in different directions. Australians think the kangaroo represents positive values, such as individual responsibility and pride.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: What good values can the kangaroo show as national spirits?\n###"}

{"prompt": "According to the most recent count, more than 6,500 homeless people sleep on the street or in shelters in San Francisco, and there are only eight shower facilities  specifically available to the homeless, and most of these have just one or two stalls and aren't open every day. Now San Francisco-based company Lava Mae, is trying to change that with a simple but smart idea--turning retired city buses into mobile showers for the homeless. The idea known as Lava Mae, is a response to the need of the homeless in the city.\nIt all started two years ago when Sandoval got in a cab after a meeting in the SoMa district of San Francisco, where the homeless mainly lived. \"My driver turned around and said, 'Welcome to the land of broken dreams.' \" Then Sandoval awoke from her imagination and started really look at the people around her. \" A woman I passed was crying and saying that she would never be clean\", Sandoval said. She took what the woman said as a sign that she should focus on the problem of hygiene , one of the most pressing needs for the homeless. \nAfter doing some research, Sandoval hit on the idea of a mobile unit that could be equipped with shower facilities. According to the company's founder Doniece Sandoval, every bus will be renewed and equipped with two separate private areas, each with a shower stall, sink, changing areas, toilet and bench. Sandoval says that if everyone sticks to a five-minute shower, a single Lava Mae bus could provide service for about 100 people during each 8- to 10-hour shift. \nThe project has been several years in the making as it has not been easy to get officials to agree. In addition, it is also difficult to ask the bus company to donate buses. Now she has reached an agreement with a bus company, which will donate the buses being retired in the next four years. \nWhile Lava Mae is now focused on the city of San Francisco, there is no reason that the idea cannot be spread all over the world.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: What is TRUE about the project of Lava Mae?\n###"}

{"prompt": "The United States estimates that about one out of every 10 people on the planet today is at least 60 years old. By 2050, it's projected to be one out of 5. This means that not only will there be more old people, but there will be relatively fewer young people to support them.\nProfessor Richard Lee of the University of California at Berkeley says this aging of the world has a great effect on economics. \"Population aging increases the concentration of population in the older ages and therefore it is costly,\" he said.\nAging populations consume   more and produce less. With more people living longer, it could get expensive. But Mr. Lee says with continuing increases in worker productivity and smart planning, it can be manageable.\nSocieties have different methods for caring for the elderly, but each carries a cost. Generally, there are three types of support. Seniors can live off the wealth they gained when they were younger. They can rely on their family to take care of them, or they can rely on the government.\nIn industrialized nations, governments created publicly-funded   support systems. These worked relatively well until recent years, when aging population growth in places like the United States and Western Europe began to gradually weaken the systems finances. These nations now face some tough choices. Mr. Lee says the elderly in some of these countries must either receive less money, retire later or increase taxes to make the system continuable.\nMost developing nations haven't built this type of government-funded support, but have instead relied on families to care for their elderly. These nations also generally have a much younger population, which means their situation is not as urgent as more developed nations. But Mr. Lee says that doesn't mean they can ignore the issue. \"Third World countries should give very careful thought to this process, to population aging and how it may affect their economies -- now, before population aging even becomes an issue,\" he explained.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: \"Aging\" in this text means .\n###"}

{"prompt": "Why do we call the sounds of birds, whales and insects songs? Because something about what we hear seems to have beauty, and some mellifluous   structure that touches us more than any possible message. Though for many years science has cautioned against hearing too much of what we humans would like to hear when we are trying to understand animal sounds, the musicality in some sounds is now starting to have an effect on the science of animal communication itself.\nMany specific animal sounds express aggression , warning, or food, but such practical explanations are tough to apply to the long songs. Some whale songs can go on for up to 24 hours. The usual explanation for birdsong is that the birds are singing to attract mates or to announce the limits of their area. But the audience is not always evident for these long love songs, which have many of the elements related to human music: rhythm, melody  , themes, repeating patterns, organization, variety, interest -- all adding up to something humans have found beautiful for thousands of years. \"Birds taught man,\" wrote Roman poet and philosopher   Lucretius, \"and taught them songs before their art began.\"\nWhat is the scientific value of such sounds? The advantage of hearing music in nature and trying to reach out to nature through music is that though we don't fully understand it, it is so accessible.\nMusic refuses explanation, but it clearly expresses something deep and important, which humans can't live without. Finding music in the sound of birds, whales and other animals makes the farther frontiers  of nature see much closer to us.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: By saying \"Birds taught man\", what did Lucretius mean?\n###"}

Only then did she come to know the importance of the beauty in a person's heart, which changed her attitude and she made friends again.\nTurning on TV,we can see many advertisements, most of which seem to give us a feeling that, physical attractiveness is the most important thing.T _ .It is surprising that more and more people,especially girls and women, try it like the first man-made beauty in China, Hao Lulu. It is a common sense that attractive people can easily find work. Most good looking guys, usually get higher scores in the job interviews. But, what is real beauty? I want to say that is inner beauty because those who have beauty in their soul are really beautiful persons.\nAs is known, the beauty judged with eyes is temporary, so we should concentrate on inner beauty. And if we make the efforts to make our minds beautiful, we'll live a happier life.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: Why did the writer refer to her friend's story?\n###"}

They had been fishing with long lines for Chilean sea bass   in the waters off the coast of New Zealand when they caught the rare squid. With two hours of hard work, the crew skillfully pulled the creature into a net and dragged it aboard their ship.\nScientists estimate   that the animal weighs about a half ton and is about 40 feet long. That would make this colossal squid the biggest on record.\nFirst identified in 1925 after two tentacles were found in a whale's stomach, the colossal squid has long been a mystery. The animals are not easy to observe because they can go down to ocean depths of 6,500 feet. What scientists do know from studying the bodies of a half dozen colossal squids is that they are fierce hunters.\nThe recently captured colossal squid has been frozen to keep it for scientific study. It will be transported to New Zealand's national museum, Te Papa, in the capital city of Wellington. Experts believe it to be the first adult male ever caught undamaged. Scientists hope to learn more about the colossal squid's diet, behavior and reproductive   patterns.\n\"Scientists will be very interested in this amazing creature,\" said New Zealand Fisheries Minister Jim Anderton. \"It adds immeasurably to our understanding of the marine environment.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: Why is it usually difficult for experts to observe the squid?\n###"}

However, as there is so much to discover, many see it as an exciting area for a new ichthyologist to enter. The second area is fisheries science, which means working with a team of scientists to find out more about different fish species. The third area is about the protection of natural fish populations. This is very important today, given that many fish species are in danger of dying out because of the actions of humans.\nTo become a successful fish scientist, you need to have a curious mind and be able to work on your own.

After three or four minutes of suspense, one horse crosses the finish line first, winning the Melbourne Cup and earning a place in history.\nThe horses that compete in the Melbourne Cup--one of the world's most famous horseraces--were fated to race. Bred for speed, these horses are the few that were singled out as having potential to become champions.\nPreparing a racehorse to compete requires a team. A horse's owner manages the team and decides which races to enter. A trainer determines the racehorse's diet and exercise. Regular exercise makes a horse less likely to be injured, but overtraining tires the horse. A groomer   cares for the racehorse and reports any problems he discovers to the trainer. And of course, no horserace could be run without a rider. These riders train for long hours and travel constantly from one race to another. They need to make a strategy, adapt to changing conditions and communicate with their horse to guide it to victory.\nAustralia's most famous horserace, the Melbourne Cup, is 3,200 meters of pure excitement. Each year 300 or 400 horses are nominated  , but only 24 can run. The competitors are chosen based on a number of factors, but winners of certain races qualify automatically.\nEach racehorse receives a handicap--a certain weight it must carry to give each horse an equal chance of winning--two months before the race. Originally, horses that seemed likely to win were assigned larger handicaps. But the rules have changed, reducing the handicap for previous winners.\nThe first Melbourne Cup in 1861 drew a crowd of 4,000 spectators, and the race's popularity has grown since then. Held on the first Tuesday of November, the cup has become a four-day festival with fine food and entertainment.\nThe Melbourne Cup began during a gold rush as a form of entertainment for the rich.

Most people don't know that there is a major difference between the two foods. No one seems to be able to determine which is which, creating a lot of confusion for people who are truly concerned with buying the best and healthiest products.\nIn 2000, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) published its official position on organic foods and made its production controlled by a strict law. While there are several standards for organic foods, foods must be grown without the use of antibiotics ,growth hormones ,chemical things and so on. The leaves of plants are one of the best choices.\nOn the other hand, natural foods have no legal rules, and are not controlled by any law. The USDA does require that seller should list the parts of natural foods, but there are no official rules for the amount of natural parts a food must contain. A natural food is usually considered to contain less chemical things, though there is no way to keep an eye on the product.\nThe USDA has guidelines for organic production. When considering buying organic foods, you must take into consideration that the organic meat, eggs and milk products must come from animals that are given no antibiotics or growth hormones.\nDue to higher labor costs, organic products cost 40% to 120% more compared with their natural foods.

Without it, the mind couldn't get done all the thinking it has to do during a normal day. You can't possibly do all your thinking with a consciousness  . Instead, your unconscious mind is working out problems all the time. Daydreaming then may be one way that the unconscious and conscious states of mind have silent dialogues.\"\nEarly psychology experts paid no attention to the importance of daydreams or even considered them harmful. In the past daydreaming was thought to be a cause of some mental illnesses. They did not have a better understanding of daydreams until the late 1980's. Eric Klinger, a professor of psychology, is the writer of the book DAYDREAMING. Klinger says. \"We know now that daydreaming is one of the main ways that we organize our lives, learn from our experiences, and plan for our futures... Daydreams really are a window on the things we fear and the things we long for in life.\"\nDaydreams are usually very simple and direct, quite unlike sleep dreams, which may be hard to understand. It's easier to gain a deep understanding of your life by paying close attention to your daydreams than by trying to examine your sleep dreams carefully. Daydreams help you recognize the difficult situations in our life and find out a possible way of dealing with them.\nDaydreams cannot be predicted.

{"prompt": "Global warming happens when greenhouse gases trap heat and light from the sun in the earths atmosphere, which increases the temperature. This is like when heat is trapped in a car. On a hot day, the car gets hotter when it is out in the parking lot. This is because the heat and light from the sun can get into the car, by going through the windows,but it can't get back out. This is what the greenhouse effect does to the earth .The heat and light can get through the atmosphere, but it can't get out. As a result,the temperature rises.\nSometimes the temperature can change in a way that helps us. The greenhouse effect makes the earth appropriate for people to live on. Without _ ,the earth would be freezing,or it would be burning hot. It would be freezing at night because we would not get the sun's heat and light .During the day, especially during the summer, it would be burning because the sun would be up with no atmosphere to filter it,so people,plants,and animals would be exposed to all the light and heat.\nAlthough the greenhouse effect makes the earth able to have people living on it,if there gets to be too many gases,the each can get unusually warmer, and many plants,animals.and people will die. Plants would die because they would not be able to take the heat .This would cause us to have less food to eat,and it would also limit the food that animals have. With less food for the animals that we need to survive we would even have less food. Gradually,people,plants,and animals would all die of hunger.\nPeople are doing many things to try to stop global warming .One thing is carpooling--driving with someone to a place that you are both going to. Another thing is being more careful about leaving electrical devices turned on. Now,more people are even riding buses or bikes to lower the amount of greenhouse gases in the air .Although adults do many things to help stop global warming,kids call do just as much.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: What is the effect of atmosphere?\n###"}

My father and I were at a grocery store, and I asked, \"What are all the flags doing here?\" He said, \"We are having the Olympic Games. That's where they honor the greatest athletes in the world.\" I said, \"Papa, someday I'm going to be an Olympic champ.\"\nWalking up the 10-meter platform, I thought to myself, \"I've waited 16 years for this moment. Am I going to win?\" So I prayed to God that I was most deserving of winning the Games.\nDAVID BOND, 90, BRITAIN\nGOLD, SAILING\nDuring the war, I spent six years in Royal Air Force. I think in general, the 1948 Olympics meant very little to most people. We were too busy after the war to be worried about sport very much anyway.\nOur team had about six weeks before the Olympics down at Torquay and we went out sailing every day.\nWinning gold was quite something. It was nice to stand on the platform with lots of people cheering. We celebrated by going to a big dance.\nMICHAEL LAPAGE, 88, BRITAIN\nSILVER, ROWING\nI started rowing when I was 14. I joined the navy in 1942. In 1945 the war came to an end and I started rowing again.\nIn 1948 we were still on rations  : 4 oz. of red meat a week. But the United States had all the meat they wanted. They were the favorites to win.\nOn the day of the final, we led the Americans at the start, but their stronger staying power took them through to win. There were no ribbons on the medals, so we just showed them round the family.\nTHOMAS GODWIN, 91, BRITAIN\nBRONZE, CYCLING\nAt 14 I left school and got a job delivering groceries on a bicycle, which excited my interest in cycling. When the war broke out, I volunteered but was held back, so I continued riding.\nAfter my team won our bronze medals, we went home just round the corner and had a sit-down and a chat and a laugh. It was a different world. Money was never, never thought about.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: What did David Bond and Thomas Godwin have in common?\n###"}

{"prompt": "There are about a billion bicycles in the world,twice as many as there are cars.But if Karl von Drais.the Baron of Sauerbronn(17851851) hadn't been such a lazy person,the bicycle may never have been invented at all.\n    Although he had a very important title (and was also a qualified and skillful engineer),the Baron was in fact a forest ranger,in other words,a gardener with responsibility for a very large garden.He was in charge of several hundred square kilometers of royal garden and forests in Central Germany.\n    In 1817.he invented a \"running machine\" that would help him get round the  _ more quickly.The machine was made of wood,and had two wheels,which were the same size.The machine had a wooden frame and a leather seat.The rider rode the machine like a horse,but with his feet on the ground.After running for a while,he could then take his feet off the ground and glide along.It was possible to change direction by controlling the front wheel.but there were no brakes! In 1863,a Frenchman called Pierre Lallement attached pedals to the front wheel of a bicycle,and the modern idea of a bicycle was born.\n    Every generation sees new designs and new interest in bicycles.Mountain bikes,for example,transformed the way people thought about cycling and introduced a new sport,which was accepted into the Olympics in 1996.\n    New materials such as titanium and carbon fiber are now used to build strong,lightweight machines and combined brake and gear systems have been developed.Englishman Chris Boardman astonished the world in the 1990s with his carbon fiber Lotus bicycle,winning Olympic gold in the 4,000 meters track pursuit in Barcelona.More recently,the Great Britain team took several medals at the Athens Olympics\n    For most people.however.the bicycle remains what it has always been-a pollution-free way of taking exercise and getting from A to B.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: What kind of gardener does the text suggest the Baron was?\n###"}
{"prompt": "People from East Asia tend to have more difficulty than those from Europe in distinguishing facial expressions--and a new report published online in Current Biology explains why.\nRachael Jack, University of Glasgow researcher, said that rather than scanning evenly across a face as Westerners do, Easterners fix their attention on the eyes.\n\"We show that Easterners and Westerners look at different face features to read facial expressions,\" Jack said. \"Westerners look at the eyes and the mouth in equal measure, whereas Easterners favor the eyes and neglect the mouth.\"\nAccording to Jack and her colleagues, the discovery shows that human communication of emotion is more complex than previously believed. As a result, facial expressions that had been considered universally recognizable cannot be used to reliably convey emotion in cross-cultural situations.\nThe researchers studied cultural differences in the recognition of facial expressions by recording the eye movements of 13 Western Whites and 13 East Asian people while they observed pictures of expressive faces and put them into categories: happy, sad, surprised, fearful, disgusted, angry, or neutral. They compared how accurately participants read those facial expressions using their particular eye movement strategies.\nIt turned out that Easterners focused much greater attention on the eyes and made significantly more errors than Westerners did. \"The cultural difference in eye movements that _ show is probably a reflection of cultural difference in facial expressions,\" Jack said. \"Our data suggest that whereas Westerners use the whole face to convey emotion, Easterners use the eyes more and mouth less.\"\nIn short, the data show that facial expressions are not universal signals of human emotion. From here on, examining how cultural factors have diversified these basic social skills will help our understanding of human emotion. Otherwise, when it comes to communicating emotions across cultures, Easterners and Westerners will find themselves lost in translation.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: What were the people asked to do in the study?\n###"}
{"prompt": "Listening, really listening, can improve communication and build respect with others. Communication begins by listening and then suggesting that you hear what the person is saying.\nThis can be recognized by focus or eye contact, body language, and reflective listening.\nFocus (Eye Contact)--Focus means that you are looking directly at the person speaking and not looking off to one side or continuing to do something else. You are focused on what is being said; the speaker is the center of attention. Listening attentively is essential for positive communication.\nListening Without Interrupting--Does your body acknowledge  that you are listening? Use smiles, nods, and expressions of understanding to communicate to the speaker that you are listening. It is not necessary that you agree or disagree at this time. It is more important for the person speaking to know that his or her words are respected. This strengthens communication.\nReflective Listening--Reflective listening involves hearing the feelings and meanings of the speaker. It is a re-statement (in different words) of what the speaker said. You, in essence, mirror the words of the speaker and rephrase them back to the speaker, checking for accuracy of understanding. This process affirms the speaker, indicates a respect of the person, and shows that you understand the speaker's message. Through careful reflection of the speaker's words, you can make clear the message and build mutual  understanding. Through reflective listening and the careful exchange of words, we learn that other people have important feelings and opinions which we need to consider. Learning to understand the importance of all ideas, not just our own, can lead to successful resolution of problems and mutual respect.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: What strengthens communication with the person speaking?\n###"}

She is speaking Mandarin.\nEnglish is rarely heard in Lisa Yang's class at the Chinese American International School(CAIS), despite the fact that few students are native speakers of Mandarin.\nThe United States is actively trying to increase the group of students in \"critical languages\" such as Mandarin. The students at CAIS are way ahead in such a trend.\nFounded 25 years ago, this small private school in San Francisco, USA, does what few other American schools do: It produces fully fluent speakers of Mandarin Chinese, by far the most commonly spoken language in the world.\nMandarin Chinese is suddenly hot in American schools. As China becomes the world's leading economy sometimes this century, schools in the U. S. are _ to add Mandarin to their list of foreign languages or expand Chinese programs already in place.\n\"It really is almost unprecedented. People are looking at China as a force to be reckoned with... And to ensure that the U. S. has the ability to conduct trade, and to work with the Chinese. Certainly having an understanding of Chinese language and culture is an advantage,\" said Marty Abbott of the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages(ACTFL).\nTo develop Chinese-language programs has not been smooth. A shortage of trained teachers has made it difficult for some schools to join the race. When schools do get teachers, they often hire them straight from China, and the teachers usually suffer culture shock when they come to the U. S.\nRobert Liu remembers his first two years in an American classroom It was not an easy adjustment. \"In China, students respect their teachers,\" he said. Liu found that American students, however, expect an active teaching style. He had to use games to engage them rather than lectures.\nTo avoid many of the problems with foreign teaching styles, the CAIS has been working with the Chinese government to improve training of teachers who are sent to the U. S.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: What kind of problem is the most difficult to adjust in teaching Chinese in America?\n###"}

{"prompt": "In today's world of cellphones, mini laptops and MP3 players, most people have at least one timetelling tool with them. Since these devices are so common, is time running out for the 500yearold watch? According to some consumers, yes. New Jersey teenager Charlie Wollman says a watch is \"an extra piece of equipment with no necessary function\". Many young adults agree -- and use their cellphones to tell time. Louis Galie, a senior vice president at Timex, said that fewer young people wear watches today than five years ago. As a result, some people claim that _ .\nHowever, watchmakers optimistically say that watches regain popularity when consumers reach their 20s and 30s. By then, they are willing to spend money on a quality timepiece that doesn't just keep good time. Fifty years ago, watchmakers boasted about their products' accuracy. But in recent years, the watch industry has transformed itself into an accessory business. And for many today, the image a watch communicates has become more important than the time it tells.\n\"Complications\" -- features that go beyond simple timekeeping -- are an important part of a watch's image. Today's watches offer a lot of features that suit almost any personality. These features include altitude trackers, compasses, lunar calendars, USB drives, and even devices that measure the effectiveness of golf swings!\nCreativity is also a key element in today's watches. For example, Japanese watchmaker Tokyoflash makes watches that don't even look like watches. The company's popular Shinshoku model uses different color lights to tell time.  It looks more like a futuristic   bracelet than a watch. Another Japanese watchmaker, EleeNo, makes a \"handless\" watch. Using a ring of circles to keep time, this watch makes an excellent conversation piece.\nWhether a watch communicates fashion sense, creative flair or a love of sports, consumers want their timepieces to stand out. Nowadays, everyone has the same kind of gadget   in their bags, so people want to make a statement with what's on their wrists.  Will this interest in wrist fashion last?

{"prompt": "Boredom and Creativity\nMost of us think of being bored at work as a negative experience, but a new study suggests it can have positive results including an increase in creativity because it gives us time to daydream.\nThat is the finding of Dr. Sandi Mann from the University of Central Lancashire. Dr. Mann conducted two studies. In the first experiment, 40 people were asked to carry out a boring task. They were told to copy numbers out of a telephone directory for 15 minutes. After that they were asked to complete another task. A pair of cups were given to each of them. Everyone tried to come up with different uses of the cups, and was given a chance to display their creativity. Meanwhile, another group of 40 people were just asked to come up with uses for the cups without doing any boring tasks before. It turned out that the 40 people who had first copied out the telephone numbers were more creative than the control group .\nTo see if daydreaming was a factor in this effect, a second boring task was introduced that allowed even more daydreaming than the boring writing task. This second study saw 30 people copying out the numbers as before, but also included a second group of 30 reading rather than writing them.\nAgain the researchers found that the people in the control group were least creative, but the people who had just read the names were more creative than those who had to write them out. This suggests that more passive boring activities, like reading or perhaps attending meetings, can lead to more creativity. Compared with reading, writing reduced the scope  for daydreaming. As a result, it reduces the effects of boredom on creativity.\nDr. Mann says: \"Boredom at work has always been seen as something to be avoided, but perhaps we should accept it in order to promote our creativity. What we want to do next is to see what the practical implications of this finding are. Do people who are bored at work become more creative in other areas of their work--or do they go home and write novels?\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: Who proved to be the most creative in the two studies?\n###"}

{"prompt": "A regular drop in the sun's radiation  can cause unusually cold winters in parts of North America and Europe, scientists say, a finding that could improve long-range forecasts and help countries prepare for snowstorms.\nScientists have known for a long time that the sun has an 11-year cycle during which radiation measured by sunspots on the surface reaches a peak then falls. But explaining a clear connection to weather is harder.\n\"Our research confirms the observed connection between solar change and regional winter climate,\" lead author Sarah Ineson of the UK Met Office told the reporters in an email. The study was published in the magazine Nature Geoscience on Monday.\nThe researchers found that the reducing of ultraviolet(UV,) radiation from the sun can affect high-altitude wind patterns in the Northern Hemisphere , causing cold winters.\n\"While UV levels won't tell us what the day-to-day weather will do, they show us the bright future of improved forecasts for winter conditions for months and even years ahead. These forecasts play an important role in long-term possibility planning,\" Ineson, a climate scientist, said.\nIneson and colleagues from Imperial College London and the University of Oxford used satellite data that more accurately  measures UV radiation from the sun and found a much greater change than previously thought.\nThey found that in years of low activity, unusually cold air forms high in the atmosphere over the tropics. This causes a redistribution  of heat in the atmosphere, making easterly winds that bring freezing weather and snowstorms to northern Europe and the United States and milder weather to Canada and the Mediterranean.\nWhen solar UV radiation is stronger, the opposite occurs.\nMore study was needed, though. A key uncertainty in the experiment lay in the satellite data used, because it covers only a few years. \"So questions remain concerning both accuracy  and also applicability to other solar cycles,\" she said.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: What will happen if the sun turns into years of high activity according to the finding?\n###"}

Eighteen is the legal drinking age, as well as the UK's voting age. But in 2013, Scottish law was changed to allow 16- and 17-year-olds in Scotland to vote in the referendum.

Clever researchers may be considered too young to have \"any right\" to present findings that do not agree with knowledge and wisdom of their elders.\nThe American is trained from children to question, analyze and search. \"Go look it up for yourself\", a child will be told.

An assignment to \"write a paper on the world's supply of sugar\" will send even a young child in search of completely unfamiliar ideas.

Due to these rising statistics, families, communities and health care providers are at a cross-road in terms of how to best serve this growing aging population.\nMany elderly individuals choose to live alone, which causes a great risk as falls and other illnesses become more likely as a person ages. In order to increase the safety and security of an elderly person living alone, researchers are examining the use of through-the-wall radar technology to detect falls and monitor the elderly in their individual living spaces.\nGraduate students were trained in walking, falling, and functioning like an elderly person and experiments were conducted in the radar-imaging lab on the campus. A clinical instructor and an expert educated and trained the students on how the elderly carry themselves and walk--with or without the assistance of canes or walkers.\nTheir research focuses on various applications for radar imaging, including search and rescue, defense, and law enforcement. Dr Amin and his team, through a grant from Qatar University, are now developing a series of algorithms   to identify the patterns and routines of an elderly person in his or her home.\nThe radar, with the help of these algorithms, can detect when a person is sitting, standing, walking and so on. They say detection of motion, and even classification of what sort of motion it is (such as walking or falling), can be achieved in all rooms inside a home with just one or a few radar units.\n\"Radar has become a mature technology,\" explains Dr Amin. \"So people have started thinking about transitioning this technology into healthcare.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: How does the radar keep track of the elderly people?\n###"}

The story in the film happens on an alien planet called Pandora where many strange species live. Among the planet's inhabitants(,),the one that has the most similarities with humans is the Na'vi, and it is the struggle between the Ma'vi and human invaders  that forms the story of the film.\nAs to the factors  leading to the film's success, many think that the entertaining feast  for the eyes and the wonderful story shouldn't be forgotten, but the new language invented especially for the film which provides audiences with a new experience also plays an important part.\nIn order to increase the truthfulness of an alien race , the film's director James Cameron asked an expert in languages from the University of Southern California to invent a language for the Na'vi. Professor Paul Frommer combined the languages spoken among Indians, Africans and mid-Asians and worked with James Caneron for four years to create the Na'vi language based on the original 30 words that the director had already come up with.\nAccording to Professor Frommer, the most important characteristic of the Na'vi language is that it could be pronounced. \"This is an alien language but obviously it has to be spoken by human actors and actresses,\" Professor Frommer told the BBC, \"it has to sound natural and it should make human beings comfortable when using it.\"\nThe language has a vocabulary of around 1000 words but Professor Formmer hopes to enlarge the vocabulary in possible follow-ups to the film and in video games. The professor hopes that one day his creation will be as successful as the Klingon alien language from the \"Star Trek\"films. \"There's a translation of Hamlet into Klingon and it has received great popularity among the audiences,\" says Professor Frommer,\"if anything like this happens to the Na'vi language, I'd be very happy.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: Who first created the basic words of the Na'vi language?\n###"}

Then he points to the phone and says, \"If there's anything else you need, just call.\" All this time you have been thinking one thing, \"How much should I tip  him?\" To make your next trip a little easier, here's a guide to tipping across some Asian countries.\nBangkok\nIn general, the more Westernized the place is, the more likely you will be expected to leave a tip. Some top-end restaurants will add a 10% service charge to the bill. If not, waiters will appreciate you tacking on  the 10% yourself. However, if you're eating at a lower-end  restaurant a tip is not necessary. If you're staying at one of Bangkok's many five-star hotels, expect to tip the porter 20 to 50 baht , depending on how many bags you have. Taxis are now metered in Bangkok. Local custom is to round the fare  up to the nearest five baht.\nHong Kong\nTipping is customary in this money-mad metropolis . Most restaurants add a 10% service charge to the bill, but the extra money often ends up in the pocket of the owner. If the service is good, add another 10% to the bill, up to HK $100 in an especially nice restaurant. For HK $10 hotel porters should do it at all but the nicest hotels where a new HK $20 bill may be more acceptable. When in a taxi, round up  to the nearest dollar.\nKuala Lumpur\nTipping in Malaysia is limited to the expensive Westernized hotels, which often add a 10% service charge to your meal or hotel room. If you are at a hotel restaurant, expect a 10% service charge. But at local restaurants, there's no need to add a tip. At five-star hotels, one or two ringgit  will content a porter. At lower-end buildings don't feel you have to tip. Like Bangkok, many taxis are now metered so you can just round up to the nearest ringgit.\nSeoul\nTipping is not part of Korean culture, although it has become a matter of course in international hotels where a 10% service charge is often added. If you're at a Korean barbecue joint , there's no need to add anything extra. But a nice Italian restaurant may require a 10% contribution. If you're at a top-end hotel, so expect to pay 500~1 000 won per bag. Taxi drivers don't accept a tip.

{"prompt": "In Victorian times, certain flowers expressed meanings because the flower selection was limited. Therefore, flower as a gift was an effective tool in social communication. With so many choices today, we have no rules in flower choosing. However, people tend to give a certain flower their own personal meaning--- maybe it can remind them of some particular friends or events. Here I would introduce the traditional meanings of some gift flowers as a reference for your flower choosing.\nCarnation  is a good gift for your female teacher or mother, but not all kinds of carnations men respect and love. Different colours have different meanings. Generally, carnation means \"fascination and woman love\". Specifically, pink carnation means \"I'll never forget you\" and red carnation says \"I admire you\". But some carnations have very negative meanings. If you want to say goodbye to your girlfriend, you can send her a bunch of striped carnations or yellow ones, because it means \"Sorry I can't be with you. You disappointed me.\"\nRose is no doubt the best gift for girls in love. Basically, it relates to the love between men and women, but roses with different colours stand for different stages of love. Red rose is man's best friend when he wants to show his love to a girl. In the peak of his love, pink rose is more suitable because it means \"perfect happiness and please believe me\". While the love gets into trouble, yellow rose seems to be the best symbol. It means \"the decrease of love and jealousy\".\nThough you are free to choose any kind of flower as long as it is beautiful, I think this breif introduction can help you avoid making mistakes. Besides, the receivers must be happier if he or she gets to know the good will you convey in flowers.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: Why do we choose certain flowers as gifts?\n###"}

{"prompt": "It is evident that there is a close connection between the capacity to use language and the capacities covered by the verb \"to think\". Indeed, some writers have identified thinking with using words: Plato coined the saying, \"In thinking the soul is talking to itself\"; J. B. Watson reduced thinking to inhibited  speech located in the minute  movements or tensions of the physiological mechanisms involved in speaking; and although Ryle is careful to point out that there are many senses in which a person is said to think and in which words are not in evidence, he has also said that saying something in a specific frame of mind is thinking a thought.\nIs thinking reducible to, or dependent upon, language habits? It would seem that many thinking situations are hardly distinguishable from the skillful use of language, although there are some others in which language is not involved. Thought cannot be simply identified with using language. It may be the case, of course, that the non-linguistic skills involved in thought can only be acquired and developed if the learner is able to use and understand language. However, this question is one which we cannot hope to answer in this book. Obviously being able to use language makes for a considerable development in all one's capacities but how precisely this comes about we cannot say.\nAt the common-sense level it appears that there is often a distinction between thought and the words we employ to communicate with other people. We often have to struggle hard to find words to capture what our thinking has already grasped, and when we do find words we sometimes feel that they fail to do their job properly. Again when we report or describe our thinking to other people we do not merely report unspoken words and sentences. Such sentences do not always occur in thinking, and when they do they are merged with vague imagery and the hint of unconscious or subliminal  activities going on just out of rage. Thinking, as it happens, is more like struggling, striving, or searching for something than it is like talking or reading.\nAgain the study of speech disorders due to brain injury disease suggests that patients can think without having adequate control over their language. Some patients, for example, fail to find the names of objects presented to them and are unable to describe simple events which they witness; they even find it difficult to interpret long written notices. But they succeed in playing games of chess or draughts. They can use the concepts needed for chess playing or draught playing but are unable to use many of the concepts in ordinary language. How they manage to do this we do not know. Presumably human beings have various capacities for thinking situations which are likewise independent of language.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: Why are patients with speech disorders able to think without having adequate control of language?\n###"}

{"prompt": "Have you ever been stuck for hours on a hard math problem? If you sat there for some time you might eventually solve it, but scientists say that daydreaming might be a much better way to tackle difficult tasks.\nIn fact, daydreaming has long been misunderstood. It's considered to be a bad thing and often associated with laziness. \"We're harsh   on ourselves if we catch ourselves mind wandering,\" says Professor Kalina Christoff from the University of British Columbia in Canada.\nBut the truth is that some of the most important scientific discoveries came about because scientists allowed their minds to wander. For example, Albert Einstein began his theory of relativity   when he daydreamed about riding a beam   of sunlight to the edge of the universe. And now, research has shown that normal people can also improve their problem-solving ability in the same way, reported The Telegraph.\nIn a study, 145 people aged between 19 and 32 were asked to list as many unusual uses as possible for everyday objects.  Some of them were given a 12-minute break while the others were not allowed any break from the task. People on the break did not simply relax - some of them were told to carry out a tiring memory task while others did an easier task.\nScientists found that people who did the easier task were daydreaming a lot. They thought about personal issues   in the past or in the future because their mind was at ease  .\nAfter the break, all participants were asked to return once again to the task of listing unusual uses for everyday objects. It was found that daydreamers improved their performance by 40percent, while all the other people, including those who didn't have a break and who did tiring tasks during the break, performed the same as before.\n\"People assume that when the mind wanders away it just gets turned off - but we show the opposite,\" explained Christoff. \"A more playful attitude might allow you to call in more resources .\" So when you are struggling to solve complicated problems, it might be better off if you switch to a simpler task and let your mind\nAccording to Christoff, people typically   spend one-third of their waking time daydreaming. \"It's a big part of our lives, but it's been largely ignored by science.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: What did the scientists discover in the experiment?\n###"}

Zoo officials said it was an act of excitement. \"He was probably just as surprised coming face to face with her as she was with him,\" Buffalo Zoo President Donna Fernandes said.\nThe keeper took refuge   inside the habitat of a female gorilla and her newborn baby.

The keeper had a good relationship with the mother who, like Koga, is a west lowland gorilla, native to West Africa and the Congo River Basin, according to Fernandes.\nSeveral locked doors prevented Koga from running wildly through the zoo and beyond.

{"prompt": "Most young people enjoy some form of physical activity. It may be walking, cycling or swimming, or in winter, skating or skiing. It may be a game of some kind: football, hockey, golf, or tennis. It may be mountaineering.\nThose who have a passion for climbing high and steep mountains are often looked upon with astonishment. Why are men and women are willing to suffer cold and hardship, and to take risks on high mountains? This astonishment is caused probably by the difference between mountaineering and other forms of activity to which men give their leisure.\nMountaineering is a sport, not a game. There are no man-made rules, as there are for such games as tennis and football. There are, of course, rules of a different kind which it would be dangerous to ignore, but it is this freedom from man-made rules that makes mountaineering attractive to many people. Those who climb mountains are free to use their own methods.\nIf we compare mountaineering and other more familiar sports, we might think that one big difference is that mountaineering is not a \"team sport\". Then we are mistaken in this. There are, it is true, no \"matches\" between \"teams\" of climbers, but when climbers are on a rock surface linked by a rope on which their lives may depend, there is obviously teamwork.\nA mountain climber knows that he may have to fight forces that are stronger and more powerful than man. He has to fight the forces of nature. This sport requires high mental and physical qualities.\nA mountain climber continues to improve his skills year after year. A skier is probably past his best by the age of thirty, and most international tennis champions are in their early twenties.

{"prompt": "Today our lives are changing faster than at any time in history. Here we report on three important changes that will have a big impact on our everyday lives in the future.\nThe cashless society\nCash and bank-notes will disappear almost completely. They will be replaced by smart cards, namely plastic cards: microchip processors loaded with some money. When we pay for goods,the shop assistant will put our smart card into a payment terminal and money will come into his card from our card. When all the money is used up,we will be able to reloadit by putting it into a telephone,dialing our bank account and money will be put into the card from the account.\nInteractive telephones\nTalking computers will play an important part. They will recognize speech, ask us what information we need, look through a database,and put the information into speech.If we want to book a flight or pay a bill by phone, we will interact with a talking computer to do so. Human telephone operators will be used only for more complex operations such as dealing with complaints or solving special problems.\nTraffic jams in cities will be reduced because drivers will use electronic route maps to find the quickest route to their destination. Electronic systems will start changing motorists for driving in cities.As soon as motorists have to pay to drive in cities, they will stop using their cars and use public transport instead. Speed control systems will be built into cars. These systems will automatically regulate the speed of the car to take account of traffic and weather conditions and prevent accidents. It will be many years before these changes bring results but when they do,there will be a _ improvement in road safety.\nWith the development of science and technology, more and more advanced things will be invented or created. Life in the future is undoubtedly different from that at the present.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: What will you do if the money in your card is used up?\n###"}
{"prompt": "When movie star Scarlett Johansson was photographed naming in Los Angeles recently, she attracted a lot of attention; for the 27-year-old actress was wearing Vibram FiveFingers, so called because they look more like gloves than shoes, with a space for each toe.\nStrange though they may look, these so-called barefoot shoes, which reproduce the effect of barefoot running but with less pain, are just one brand in a range of minimalist footwear. These super-thin sports shoes are causing a stir in the world of running and fitness. Why? Because some experts believe _ could make you a better, more efficient runner and that traditional trainers could be doing you more harm than good.\n\"Wearing a shoe that has lots of cushioning and support affects the way your body naturally moves and studies suggest that this carries a higher risk of injury,\" explains Matt Wallden, an athlete performance expert. \"But with barefoot shoes, the foot can actually feel the firmness and shape of the ground, which allows your body to respond effectively.'\"\nBut before you rush out to invest in minimalist footwear, be careful. These kinds of shoes are not meant for everyone, or at least not straight away.\n\"Ordinary sports shoes with support are good for beginners whose bodies are not used to the impact of running,\" explains Patrick Davoren, former Olympic athlete. \"If you are not in great condition, then running in minimalist footwear may cause injuries and will turn a lot of people off exercise and running.\nIf you are currently injured, and figures show that in any given year 65% of all runners are, it can be tempting to try anything that promises to get you back on the road, trail, or beach. But barefoot running is not a method of treating injury nor is it a magical way of suddenly turning you into a great athlete.\nEven if you're used to running, when you start using minimalist shoes you should build up your distance gradually. Start _ off'by doing just 10% of what you'd normally run and increase the distance by no more than 10% every week. And a word of warning - you may never have soft feet again\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: Where would you probably read this article?\n###"}

Asians feel there will be less unfair treatment in areas like mathematics and science because they will be judged more objectively. And the return on the investment in education is more immediate in something like engineering than with an arts degree.\nMost Asian-American students owe their success to the influence of parents who are determined that their children take full advantage of what the American educational system has to offer. An effective measure of parental attention is homework. Asian parents spend more time with their children than American parents do, and it helps. Many researchers also believe there is something in Asian culture that breeds success, such as ideals that stress family values and emphasize education.\nBoth explanations for academic success worry Asian Americans because of fears that they feed a typical racial image.

{"prompt": "IT'S a mystery that has puzzled scientists. Five years ago, researchers found an area in the Atlantic Ocean seabed, where a part of the Earth's outer layer, or crust , is  missing. A thick layer of dark green rock, which is usually found deep inside the planet, lies exposed.\nThe crust, mantle  and core  are the main layers that make up the planet. The mantle rests between the crust and the core.\nLast month, a team of 12 British scientists set off on a six-week trip to study the hole in the crust.\nThe hole is about 4,800 meters below sea level and is believed to be more than 48,000 meters long and more than 48,000 meters wide. Scientists think that there are other nearby gaps. \"It is like a window into the interior   of the Earth,\" says scientist   Bramley Murton, who is part of the research team.\nThe site where the hole is located is part of a ridge   of undersea volcanoes.  There, two of the plates that make up the Earth's surface meet. The plates are always   moving. When the plates move away from each other, lava rushes up from the mantle to   fill the gap and form a new crust. But this did not happen in the area where the hole is located.\nThe hole is giving researchers a good opportunity to study what's below the Earth's   surface. The team will use a special robotic tool to film the area and get samples of the exposed mantle. They hope to study everything from the chemistry of the oceans to how the Earth's surface behaves under the sea.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: How does the hole come into being?\n###"}

{"prompt": "The Pacific island nation of Nauru used to be a beautiful place. Now it is an ecological disaster area. Nauru's heartbreaking story could have one good consequence -- other countries might learn from its mistakes.\nFor thousands of years, Polynesian people lived the remote island of Nauru, far from western civilization. The first European to arrive was John Fearn in 1798. He was the British captain of the Hunter, a whaling ship. He called the island Pleasant Island.\nHowever, because it was very remote, Nauru had little communication with Europeans at first. The whaling ships and other traders began to visit, bringing guns and alcohol. These elements destroyed the social balance of the twelve family groups on the island. A ten-year civil war started, which reduced the population from 1,400 to 900.\nNauru's real troubles began in 1899 when a British mining company discovered phosphate  on the island. In fact, it found that the island of Nauru was nearly all phosphate, which a very important fertilizer for farming. The company began mining the phosphate.\nA phosphate mine is not a hole in the ground; it is a strip mine. When a company strip-mines, it removes the top layer of soil. Then it takes away the material it wants. Strip mining totally destroys the land. Gradually, the lovely island of Nauru started to look like the moon.\nIn 1968, Nauru became one of the richest countries in the world. Every year the government received millions and millions of dollars for its phosphate.\nUnfortunately, the leaders invested the money unwisely and lost millions of dollars. In addition, they used millions more dollars for personal expenses. Soon people realized that they had a terrible problem -- their phosphate was running out. Ninety percent of their island was destroyed and they had nothing. By 2000, Nauru was financially ruined. Experts say that it would take approximately $433,600,000 and more than 20 years to repair the island. This will probably never happen.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: What was Nauru like before the Europeans came?\n###"}

{"prompt": "Beer and fried chicken -- Thanks to a South Korean drama currently on air, Man From the Stars, this new mix-and-match junk food trend has become popular among young audiences, despite its unhealthy nature. Indeed, South Korean TV dramas, or K-drama for short, have been a major force in the South Korean pop-culture wave that has captured the hearts of young Chinese audiences. According to iQiyi, a video website that features Man From the Stars, by Feb 15, the number of views for the TV drama hit 370 million in China.\n\"It is interesting to explore what elements of those dramas appeal to audiences. It's obviously more than just pretty faces,\" says Yan Feng, a professor of Chinese literature at Fudan University. Reflected by audiences, culture critics and insiders of the industry, youth fantasy, creative storylines, cultural _ , and well-organized production all add up to K-drama's success, along with, of course, those handsome and cute faces dressed in the latest fashion trends.\n\"Everyone fancies a perfect partner, handsome or beautiful,\" says Zhou Ying, a professor at Chongqing Technology and Business University. \"The South Korean TV industry is feeding this need.\" After Lee Min-ho appeared on CCTV's annual Spring Festival gala, he became the most famous South Korean in China. Only weeks later, Kim Soo-hyun, lead actor in Man From the Stars, swept the country. Apart from pretty faces, fashion is another highlight of the series. Each time actors from the series wear a new set of outfits, similar clothes experience a sales boom online, according to Xiao Yi, a Taobao store owner.\nAs is known, with love triangles, incurable diseases, and Cinderella tales, storylines in South Korean dramas may seem a bit commonplace. While The Man From the Stars challenges this by putting aliens and time travel into these existing stories, Peng Sanyuan, a screenwriter, says a focus on detail is a key factor in the success of these dramas. \"In order to accurately target audiences and find emotional reflections with them, more and more female writers are working in the industry,\" says Peng about her experience of exchanging ideas with South Korean colleagues.

{"prompt": "During the 19th century, women's education was not considered important in the United States. Supporters of advanced education for women faced many problems. States did require each town to provide a school for children, but teachers were often poorly prepared. Most young women were not able to continue on with their education in private schools. If they did, they often were not taught much except the French language, how to sew   clothing, and music.\nMary Lyon felt that women's education was extremely important. Through her lifelong work for education she became the most famous woman in the 19th century America. She believed that women were teachers both at home and in the classroom. And she believed that efforts to better educate young women also served God. If women were better educated, she felt, they could teach in local schools throughout the United States and in foreign countries.\nIn 1837, Mary Lyon opened Mount Holyoke Seminary for Women. Only four teachers and the first class of eighty young women lived and studied in the building when the school opened. But Mary knew the importance of what had been established   -- the first independent school for the higher education of women. The school continued to grow. In 1893, under a state law, Mount Holyoke Female Seminary became a college. Mount Holyoke College was the first college to offer women the same education as was offered to men.\nPeople who have studied Mary Lyon say she was not fighting a battle   of equality between men and women, yet she knew she wanted more for women. Her efforts led to the spread of higher education for women in the United States. Historians say she was the strongest influence on the education of American young people during the middle of the 19th century.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: What did Mary Lyon think would be a result of better education for women?\n###"}
{"prompt": "At 10:35 a.m. on December 17, 1903, two brothers from Ohio flew the first successful airplane for 12 seconds and 120 feet along a beach in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. With Orville flying first, the brothers took turns as pilot, and they flew three more times that day. On their fourth try, they managed to go 852 feet in 59 seconds ----an amazing feat at the time. The two brothers had invented powered flight. \nOrville and Wilbur Wright owned a bicycle shop in Dayton, Ohio. Although they had not gone to school to learn about airplanes or engineering, they were good mechanics. By repairing bicycles, they had learned how gears and pulleys worked. They also learned to take careful notes about what they saw. Each time they made a new design and tested a machine, they took notes and made drawings. They would study these to figure out what they could do better the next time.\nBefore the Wright brothers flew, they did many things to prepare for this extraordinary achievement. They read everything they could find about air, balloons, and kites. Then they made careful sketches of what they wanted to build. They began by making model kites to learn how air flowed over wings. They made them bigger and bigger until they had a glider -- a kite that is big enough to hold a person, but with no engine. The Wright brothers made three gliders before building their first airplane. Each time they made a glider, they would test it, make careful observations, and then improve their design. \nWhen they made a glider that flew well, they added an engine. This step was harder than it sounds, because they had to find an engine that was both light-weight and powerful. The engines that they could buy were either too heavy or too weak, so they asked their friend Charlie Taylor to help them build one. The first engine that Charlie built broke almost immediately, but the second one worked well.   \nAfter Orville and Wilbur installed the engine in their plane, they were almost ready. They simply had to wait for the perfect day with just the fight amount of wind. On the morning of December 17, 1903, they had their chance. And the airplane flew into history.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: What was the speed of the first flight?\n###"}

{"prompt": "America used to have a strong college education system for prison inmates (prisoners). It was seen as a way to _ men and women in prison by helping them go straight when they got out.\nThose taxpayer-supported college classes were put to an end in the 1990s. But New York Governor Andrew Cuomo would like to bring them back in the state, setting off a fierce new debate.\nA number of lawmakers in New York have promised to kill Cuomo's proposal  .\nCuomo says reintroducing taxpayer-funded college classes in New York's prisons is a common-sense plan that will reduce the number of inmates who commit new crimes.\n\"You pay $ 60,000 for a prison cell for a year,\" Cuomo responded. \"You put a guy away for 10 years, and that's $600,000. Right now, chances are almost half. Once he's set free, he's going to come right back.\"\nCuomo says helping inmates get a college education would cost about $ 5,000 a year per person. He argues, \"It's a small amount of money if it keeps that inmate from bouncing back into prison.\"\nBut even some members of the governor's own party hate this idea. State Assemblywoman Addie Russell, whose upstate district includes three state prisons, says taxpayers just won't stand for inmates getting a free college education, while middle-class families struggle to pay for their kids' college fees.\n\"That is the vast majority of feedback   that I'm also getting from my constituents  ,\" she says. \"You know, 'Where is the relief for the rest of the population who obey the law ?' \"\n\"I was very disappointed that the policy had been changed,\" says Gerald Gaes, who served as an expert on college programs for the Federal Bureau of Prisons in the 1990s.

{"prompt": "Even as Americans have been gaining weight, they have cut their average fat intake from 36 to 34 percent of their total diets in the past 15 years.  And indeed,  cutting fat  to control or lose weight makes sense. Fat has nine calories per gram. Protein and carbohydrates  have just four. Moreover, the body uses fewer calories to metabolize fat than it does to metabolize other foods. Compared with protein and carbohydrates -- which break down into amino acids and simple sugars, respectively, and can be used to strengthen and energize the body ---- dietary fat is more easily converted to body fat. Therefore, it's more likely to stay on buttocks, thighs and bellies.\nBut cutting fat from your diet doesn't necessarily mean your body won't store fat. For example, between nonfat and regular cookies, there's trivial difference in calories because manufacturers make up for the loss of fat by adding sugar. Low-fat crackers, soups and dressings can also be just as high in calories as richer versions. No matter where the calories come from, overeating will still cause weight again. The calories from fat just do it a little quicker. A Wisconsin computer programmer who decided with a diet coach to eat only 40 grams of fat a day learned the lesson firsthand. He wasn't losing weight. Then he showed his food diary to his coach and revealed he'd been eating half a pound of jelly beans a day. \"They don't have any fat,\" he explains. But they had enough sugar to keep him from shedding an ounce. \nNonfat foods become add-on foods. When we add them to our diet, we actually increase the number of calories we eat per day and gain weight. That was borne out in a Pennsylvania State University study. For breakfast, Prof. Barbara Rolls gave two groups of women yogurt that contained exactly the same amount of calories. One group's yogurt label said \"high fat\"--the other, \"low fat.\" The \"low fat\" yogurt group ate significantly more calories later in the day than the other group. \"People think they've saved fat and can indulge themselves later in the day with no adverse consequences,\" says Richard Mattes, a nutrition researcher at Purdue University. \"But when they do that, they don't compensate very precisely, and they often end up overdoing it.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: What lessons did the computer programme learn ?\n###"}
{"prompt": "Kodak's decision to file for bankruptcy   protection is a sad, though not unexpected, turning point for a leading American corporation that pioneered consumer photography and dominated the film market for decades, but ultimately failed to adapt to the digital revolution.\nAlthough many attribute Kodak's downfall to \"complacency   ,\" that explanation doesn't acknowledge the lengths to which the company went to reinvent itself. Decades ago, Kodak predicted that digital photography would overtake film   -- and in fact, Kodak invented the first digital camera in 1975 -- but in a fateful decision, the company chose to shelf its new discovery to focus on its traditional film business.\n\"It wasn't that Kodak was blind to the future\", said Rebecca Henderson, a professor at Harvard Business School, but rather that it failed to execute on a strategy to confront it. By the time the company realized its mistake, it was too late.\nKodak is an example of a firm that was very much aware that they had to adapt, and spent a lot of money trying to do so, but ultimately failed. Large companies have a difficult time switching into new markets because there is a temptation to put existing assets   into the new businesses.\nAlthough Kodak predicted the unavoidable rise of digital photography, its corporate   culture was too rooted in the successes of the past for it to make the clean break necessary to fully embrace the future. They were a company stuck in time. Their history was so important to them. Now their history has become a liability.\nKodak's downfall over the last several decades was dramatic. In 1976, the company commanded 90% of the market for photographic film and 85% of the market for cameras. But the 1980s brought new competition from Japanese film company Fuji Photo, which undermined Kodak by offering lower prices for film and photo supplies. Kodak's decision not to pursue the role of official film for the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics was a major miscalculation. The bid went instead to Fuji, which exploited its sponsorship to win a permanent foothold in the marketplace.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: Why do large companies have difficulty switching to new markets?\n###"}

{"prompt": "When you are admitted to a local university, especially one without accommodation, perhaps you'll live at home and become a commuting student which benefits you. It's cheaper and you can have a comfortable and familiar situation, which means you'll enjoy home meals you're used to instead of the changeless food in the university cafe.\nHowever, commuting students need to try their best to get involved in the life of their college and to take special steps to meet their fellow students. Often, this means you should be active to seek out and talk to people in your classes whom you think you might like.\nOne problem that commuting students sometimes face is their parents' unwillingness to recognize that they're adults. The change from high school to college is a big one, and if you live at home you need to develop the same kind of independence you'd have when you were living away. Home rules that might have been appropriate when you were in high school don't apply.

{"prompt": "When you are admitted to a local university, especially one without accommodation, perhaps you'll live at home and become a commuting student which benefits you. It's cheaper and you can have a comfortable and familiar situation, which means you'll enjoy home meals you're used to instead of the changeless food in the university cafe.\nHowever, commuting students need to try their best to get involved in the life of their college and to take special steps to meet their fellow students. Often, this means you should be active to seek out and talk to people in your classes whom you think you might like.\nOne problem that commuting students sometimes face is their parents' unwillingness to recognize that they're adults. The change from high school to college is a big one, and if you live at home you need to develop the same kind of independence you'd have when you were living away. Home rules that might have been appropriate when you were in high school don't apply.

But Tammy wasn't happy.Inspired by a web site,they began donating some of their belongings to charity, and eventually got rid of their cars.Some thought they were crazy,but now they feel much happier.Without debt and working fewer hours,now they have more time to be outdoors and to volunteer.\n\"The idea that you need to go bigger to be happy is false,\"Ms. Strobel says. \"I really believe that the acquisition of material goods doesn't bring about happiness.\"\nDespite the fact that the economy is not as booming as it was,studies have shown that many are feeling happier as they save more and spend less.This mainly happens when they spend money on experiences instead of material objects and when they relish what they plan to buy long before they buy it.\nIt is true that extra cash always makes life a little easier because it lets people meet basic needs.But scholars have found that types of purchases,their size and frequency,and even the timing of the spending all affect long-term happiness.One major finding is that spending money for an experience---concert tickets,French lessons, sushi-rolling classes---produces longer-lasting satisfaction.\nAt the height of the recession in 2008,consumers were doing something different---vacationing in their yards, eating more dinners at home,organizing family game nights .As a result, these leisure activities appeared to make them less lonely and increased their interactions with others.\n\"I think people are realizing they don't need what they had.They're more interested in creating memories,\"says a scholar.\nTo stop purchasing things using credit cards at any time brings happiness,too;in other words,waiting for something and working hard to get it makes it feel more valuable and more stimulating.

{"prompt": "Eight in 10 Americans eat fast food at least once a month and half eat it every week according, to a Gallup Poll. Yet most people who eat fast food know it's bad for them. So why do they keep eating it?\nThe answer is simple: the benefits of eating fast food outweigh the long-term implications for most people. However, once you read these reasons why all those trips to the drive through may be slowly killing you, you may just want to stop eating fast food after all.\n1. Fast food makes you fat.\nA 15-year study of over 3,000 people found that eating fast food is linked to weight gain and insulin resistance. In others words, fast food makes you fat and increases your risk of type 2 diabetes. You probably know this already. But here's something you may not know.\n2. Fast food is addictive.\nThe more you eat fast food, the more you crave it. One study found that fast food is \"a potentially addictive substance that is most likely to create dependence in vulnerable populations.\" If you eat fast food once a week or more, you may be addicted to it.\n3. Fast food is affecting your kids.\nAccording to the CDC, childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and tripled in adolescents in the past 30 years. Kids have an amazing ability to recall ads they've seen. Fast food marketers know this, and design ads accordingly. Research shows strong associations between increases in advertising for non-nutritious foods and rates of childhood obesity.\n4. Fast food \"burgers\" don't have much burger in them.\nOne study found that most fast food burgers are composed of about 50 percent water and the actual meat content is only 2.1 to 14.8 percent. So what makes up the rest of it, you ask? Chemical fillers and preservatives, mostly. That's why we see read horror stories about burgers that don't go bad.\n5. Even \"healthy\" fast food isn't that healthy.\nFast food restaurants are catering to consumer demands to produce healthier options. The problem is, their definition of \"healthy\" is quite lax. One of the healthiest dishes at Burger King, the Garden Fresh Salad Chicken Caesar with TENDERGRILL Chicken and dressing, still has almost 500 calories and 28 grams of fat, and nearly a day's worth of sodium.\n6. Fast food is inhumane to animals.\nOkay, this one may not be a reason why fast is killing you, but it's still a compelling reason to stop eating fast food. 9 billion animals were slaughtered in the US alone in 2012 and much of that meat is for your fast food burgers and chicken sandwiches. Large factory farms resemble more of a \"business\" than a \"farm.\" Animals suffer in crowded spaces where they rarely have access to the outdoors or sunlight. They are pumped full of antibiotics to combat disease, which runs rampant in these conditions. Livestock is one of the biggest sources of pollution and environmental negligence, according to the UN.\n7. Fast food sodas are loaded with sugar.\nHigh fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is the cheap sweetener most fast food restaurants use in their sodas, desserts, and many other products. Princeton University researchers linked HFCS consumption to obesity in an animal study. Rats given HFCS gained more weight and body fat than those given table sugar.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: How many factors are mentioned which can account for the reason why fast food is slowly killing you?\n###"}

{"prompt": "An old problem is getting new attention in the United States--bullying. Recent cases included the tragic case of a 15-year-old girl whose family moved from Ireland. She hanged herself in Massachusetts following months of bullying. Her parents criticized her school for failing to protect her. Officials have brought criminal charges against several teenagers.\nJudy Kuczynski is president of an anti-bullying group called Bully Police USA. Her daughter Tina was also the victim of severe bullying starting in middle school in the state of Minnesota. She said,\"Our daughter was a very outgoing child. She was involved in all kinds of things and had lots of friends. And over a period of time her grades fell completely. She started having health issues. She couldn't sleep. She wasn't eating. She had terrible stomach pains and didn't want to go to school.\"\nBullying is defined as negative behavior repeated over time against the same person. It can involve physical violence, or it can be verbal--for example, insults or threats. Spreading lies about someone or excluding a person from a group is known as social or relational bullying.\nAnd now there is cyber-bullying, which uses the Internet, e-mail or text messages. It has easy appeal for the bully because it does not involve face-to-face contact and it can be done at any time.\nThe first serious research studies into bullying were done in Norway in the late 1970s. The latest government study in the United States was released last year. It found that about one-third of students age twelve to eighteen were bullied at school.\nSusan Swearer is a psychologist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and co-director of the Bullying Research Network. She says schools should treat bullying as a mental health problem to get bullies and victims the help they need. She says bullying is connected to depression, anxiety and anti-social behavior and bullies are often victims themselves.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: Why is cyber-bullying appealing to the bully?\n###"}
{"prompt": "Between their crazy schedules and upside-down circadian  rhythms, teens have always been somewhat sleep-deprived .Now technology is making it worse.\nTeens are not just texting, instant-messaging and surfing Facebook all day; they're sleeping with their cell phones or laptops, too.Or rather, not sleeping.And doctors and parents, many of whom raised in an era when phones were attached to walls, are concerned.\n\"So many teens are having sleep issues, and parents aren't necessarily regulating the use of the electronic devices enough,\" says Margie Ryerson, a therapist.\"It's impossible to wind down and relax the body, the mind, the senses and be ready to fall asleep.\"\n\"We all know teens don't get enough sleep in general,\" says San Francisco.\"As long as parents allow teens to have these devices in their bedrooms at night, teens will be tempted  to use them.\"... Teens would socialize 24/7 if they could.\nRyerson calls it _ -- round-the-clock reports on breaking news about everything, from homework to wardrobe choices to ice-cream cravings.\nSleep deprivation is linked to memory and concentration problems, anxiety and depression, and moodiness.\"Many people assume these problems arise directly from adolescence, which is not really true,\" he says.\"The real issue is sleep deprivation.Late-night texting can certainly make the situation worse.\"\n\"The psychology behind this constant contact is certainly understandable,\" Ryerson says.\"It comes from wanting to avoid being left out.They won't be considered important and significant in their peer group, if they don't know what's going on.If they're on top of everything, they belong,\" she says.\n\"What helps, at least for younger kids,\" says Ryerson, \"is parental involvement.If all of their friends are all able to text into the early hours of the night, it is hard for a middle or high schooler to set the limit themselves.Often they appreciate parents stepping in.\"\n\"As parents, we want our kids to be happy, healthy and responsible,\" she says, \"and the most necessary requirement for achieving balance is to first take care of ourselves physically -- eating well, exercising and getting enough sleep.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: Why do teens keep texting all the time?\n###"}
{"prompt": "From self-driving cars to carebots (care+robots) for elderly people, rapid development in technology has long represented a possible threat to many jobs normally performed by people. But experts now believe that almost 50 percent of occupations existing today will be completely unnecessary by 2025 as artificial intelligence continues to change businesses.\n\"The next fifteen years will see a revolution in how we work, and a revolution will necessarily take place in how we plan and think about workplaces,\" said Peter Andrew, Director of Workplace Strategy for CBRE Asia Pacific.\nA growing number of jobs in the future will require creative intelligence, social skills and the ability to use artificial intelligence.\nThe report is based on interviews with 200 experts, business leaders and young people from Asia Pacific, Europe and North America. It shows that in the US technology already destroys more jobs than it creates.\nBut the report states: \"Losing occupations does not necessarily mean losing jobs -- just changing what people do.\" Growth in new jobs could occur as much, according to the research.\n\"The growth of 20 to 40 person companies that have the speed and technological know-how will directly challenge big companies,\" it states.\nA 2014 report by Pew Research found 52 percent of experts in artificial intelligence and robotics were optimistic about the future and believed there would still be enough jobs in the next few years. The optimists pictured \"a future in which robots do not take the place of more jobs than they create,\" according to Aaron Smith, the report's co-author.\n\"Technology will continue to affect jobs, but more jobs seem likely to be created.

{"prompt": "I travel a lot, and I find out different \"styles\" of directions every time I ask \"How can I get to the post office?\"\nForeign tourists are often confused  in Japan because most streets there don't have names; in Japan, people use landmarks in their directions instead of street names. For example, the Japanese will say to travelers,\"Go straight down to the corner. Turn left at the big hotel and go past a fruit market. The post office is across from the bus stop. \"\nIn the countryside of the American Midwest, there are not usually many landmarks. There are no mountains, so the land is very flat; in many places there are no towns or buildings within miles. Instead of landmarks, people will tell you directions and distances. In Kansas or Iowa, for example, people will say,\" Go north two miles. Turn east, and then go another mile. \"\nPeople in Los Angeles, California, have no idea of distance on the map; they measure distance in time, not miles. \"How far away is the post office?\" you ask. \"Oh,\" they answer,\"it's about five minutes from here. \" You say,\" Yes, but how many miles away is it?\"They don't know.\nIt's true that a person doesn't know the answer to your question sometimes.

Stop looking at me!\" \nFor a while I shouted insults at Amy too, just so I could fit in. After all, I didn't want the other kids treating me the same as they treated Amy.

I didn't know how to stop my schoolmates insulting Amy until the night of our class skating party.\nOur whole class was there, including Amy. Amy didn't know how to skate, but I could see how much she wanted to have fun like the rest of us. So I skated over to her and took her by the hand. Holding her hand, I slowly pulled her, and together we began the journey around the skating rink. I didn't say a word to her, and she didn't speak to me. She just smiled, and every once in a while she would laugh in excitement.\nThe next morning, on the school bus the other kids talked a lot about Amy and me. But nobody insulted her or me.

These deaf people were not able to use a spoken language.\nBut, beginning in the 1700s, the deaf were taught a special language. Using this language, they could share thoughts and ideas with others. The language they used was a language without sound. It was a sign language.\nHow did this sign language work?  The deaf were taught to make certain movements with their hands, faces and bodies. These movements stood for things and ideas. A man might move his finger across his lips. This meant, \"You are not telling the truth.\" He might tap his chin (, )with three fingers. This meant \"my uncle\".\nThe deaf were also taught to use a finger alphabet . They used their fingers to make letters of the alphabet. In this way, they spelled out words. Some deaf people could spell out words at a speed of 130 words per minute.\nSign language and finger spelling are not used as much as they once could.

{"prompt": "When was the last time you did something really fun with one of your parents--just the two of you?\nParents who take their young children to music, swimming and art classes often stop arranging such activities once their kids are older and in school all day. But it doesn't have to be that way. Doing something enjoyable with your kids just might make you look at each other in a whole new way, especially if you do it through a class or an event. When parent and child become students together, it puts them on the same level, at least for a while.\n\"I really like parents to come to class with their kids--they start sharing things and talking about what they're doing and what they like,\" said art teacher Pyper Dixon.\nHowever, finding something new in common is a big choice for them, especially when kids get involved in sports and other after-school activities. But it's possible to learn a new skill or hobby together.\nThat's certainly true of Lauren, 11, of Silver Spring, who is in Dixon's class with her father, Dennis. \"I was just going to drop her off,\" Dennis said, \"but Dixon persuaded me to stay.\"\nNow Lauren gets to _ her father about doing his art homework. \"He always leaves it to the last minute,\" she said. \"But then he'll turn around to do amazing drawings,\" she added, \"We have different styles of drawing, so it's interesting to talk it over with him.\"\nWithout the Saturday morning art class, Dennis said, he would be reading the paper, and Lauren would be on her own in her room or on the computer. But they talk more now. \"I can't think of an experience where you communicate with your kid so closely,\" he said.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: What does Dixon think is the benefit of parent and child studying art together?\n###"}
{"prompt": "When you are invited to attend a party in the West, the first important thing you need to know is that you should arrive late.\nIt is a great embarrassment to arrive at a party early or even on time. Therefore, unless you are the host of the party, you never want to be the first person present at a party. Why? Because others may think that you have no life or nothing better to do than wait for a party to start. Many people try to project an image of always being busy, which, whether true or not, has something to do with success. So, by arriving late, you are implying: \"I live a full life and it's really exciting.\"\nTherefore, an 8 o'clock party usually doesn't really start until maybe 9 o'clock, as everyone wants to be thought of as a busy and important person with lots of things to do. In other words, a party is one of those rare occasions in which your _ can actually hurt you. It's quite a strange thing, isn't it? Anyhow, remember to be late!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: What is the reason that people want to be late for parties?\n###"}

On the other hand, the hosts that guests write to me about have taken some extreme measures to reduce the cost of their hospitality. These range from a dinner party where a relative of the host explained how expensive the steaks were and \"rather pointedly suggested\" that the letter writer \"make a financial contribution\" to the cost of dinner, to some Cape Cod homeowners who invited a couple to spend a weekend with them -- as long as they brought their own food, bottled water, and toilet paper.\nWeddings and other special events always create extra sources of stress, worsened by the fact that people rarely want to talk honestly about their money situations.

{"prompt": "Attempt a guess at the following question: In the English-speaking world, which country has the least affordable homes? You are wrong if you guessed the US, even with the housing bubble   and main sadness. Nor is it the UK, where prices have risen because demand is far from supply. According to a recent survey of 227 cities around the globe, you must go south of the equator   to Australia to find the priciest homes.\nThe report measured a city's housing market along the following guidelines. An \"affordable\" home required three times or less of the average family's income to purchase. At four times earnings, a home fell into the \"unaffordable\" category. And a \"seriously unaffordable\" home needed five times a family's income. In Australia, homes in the least affordable city cost just about 9.5 times the average income. Sydney, Perth, and Melbourne were only a little under this figure.\nAustralian officials offered little comment, apart from a general statement on the _ findings. These prices make the possibility that many Australians will one day own a home largely unbelievable. Land rationing   and excessive development charges have raised prices, and the problem will only be solved through urgent action by the Rudd government.\nSome American cities were also included on the least affordable list, four of which were in California. America is still involved in a mortgage crisis, though, affecting the affordability of homes. Yet a number of US cities garnered \"affordable\" status, namely Dallas and Kansas. Australia had no cities listed in the top fifty places with affordable homes.\nThe survey suggests that you can find affordable homes in most places, just not if you're Australian and choose to live down under.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: What caused the prices of houses to increase in Australia?\n###"}

{"prompt": "An earthquake is one of the most common natural disasters. It may cause great damage. So it is wise to learn some simple safety tips to protect yourself or your family members.\n _ items, like those made of glass are easily broken and should usually be placed on a lower surface, near the ground instead of placing them on cupboards higher up. Never place them near your bed, sofas and other furniture where you would be sitting or lying down. When there is a strong movement, these pieces will fall on the floor directly and not on you.\nThere is a strong chance of short circuits   and fire breakouts during an earthquake. Make sure you turn off electrical connections and gas immediately when an earthquake happens.\nDuring an earthquake, lie beneath an object that is not easily damaged. Do not go near objects that could directly fall on you. Never use the elevator to go down. Stay inside until the shaking stops and it is safe to go outside. Research has shown that most injuries happen when people inside buildings try to go out. Use the staircases at all times.\nIf you are outdoors, do not take shelter under a tree, streetlights, electric poles or tall buildings. If you are driving, stop your car and stay in a safe place. Do not park your car under a tree or any tall object.\nIf trapped in debris  , cover your mouth with a handkerchief or clothing. Tap on a pipe or wall so rescuers can find you. Use a whistle   if one is available. Never shout for help. Shouting can cause you to breathe in dangerous amounts of dust. Do not light a match because you may burn yourself.

So fishing boats went farther than ever.but If the return trip took more than a few days, the fish were not fresh.

{"prompt": "Plastic is one of the most important technological discoveries of the 20th century. However, it may soon be replaced. The new development- liquid wood- can replace plastics in all branches of modern-day industries.\nPlastic as a material enjoys the biggest demand in the modern world, but it does have a number of drawbacks. First and foremost, plastic isn't recyclable. Secondly, it contains toxins   helping develop cancerous diseases. Finally, it's made of oil and oil reserves aren't endless.\nThe liquid wood technology is likely to replace plastic and providing mankind with new materials for many years ahead. Norbert Eisenfreich, a senior researcher at the Faunhofer Institute for Chemical Technology in Germany (ICT), said that arboform, the new material, is made of lignin , which can be obtained from soft tissues of wood. Once mixed with several other matenals, it turns into solid and non-toxic _ for plastics.\nICT team leader Emilia Regina Inone-Kauffmann said the wood-working industry separates wood into three basic components, including lignin. Lignin isn't used for the production of paper. Specialists of ICT mixed lignin with several natural materials and thus invented the material which could be melted and molded  .\nWhen solid, arboform looks like plastic and possesses tho qualitie of polished wood. It can be used for the production of any items. Arboform is already used for the production of car parts which require extra strength. In addition, liquid wood can be recycled repeatedly. The material preserved all of its qualities even if it's reprocessed ten times.\nHowever, the new invention doesn't enjoy an extensive use due to the high content of sulfur  in it.

Do you have any suggestions for us where we might find a room?\"\nWell, that didn't surprise me. After all, it was the busy time of the year for tourism. As he spoke, I noticed that his wife was pregnant  . I told them that they should just keep searching and wished them good luck in their search. The young husband didn't say any other words and backed out of the car-park and headed off. We also got into our car and drove home.\nAfter a short drive, I couldn't get this young couple out of my mind. Here they were, traveling in a different state, tired, the wife pregnant. It was at that moment that my wife told me we needed to go back and find that couple. We went back and looked for them. We even went as far as the mountain.

{"prompt": "Scientists today are making greater effort to study ocean currents   . Most do it using satellites and other high-tech equipment. However, ocean expert Curtis Ebbesmeyer does it in a special way -- by studying movements of random floating garbage. A scientist with many years' experience, he started this type of research in the early 1990s when he heard about hundreds of athletic shoes washing up on the shores of the northwest coast of the United States. There were so many shoes that people were setting up _ to try and match left and right shoes to sell or wear.\nEbbesmeyer found out in his researches that the shoes -- about 60,000 in total -- fell into the ocean in a shipping accident. He phoned the shoe company and asked if they wanted the shoes back. As expected, the company told him that they didn't. Ebbesmeyer realized this could be a great experiment. If he learned when and where the shoes went into the water and tracked where they landed, he could learn a lot about the patterns of ocean currents.\nThe Pacific Northwest is one of the world's best areas for beachcombing  because winds and currents join here, and as a result, there is a group of serious beachcombers in the area. Ebbesmeyer got to know a lot of them and asked for their help in collecting information about where the shoes landed. In a year he collected reliable information on 1, 600 shoes. With this data, he and a colleague were able to test and improve a computer program designed to model ocean currents, and publish the findings of their study.\nAs the result of his work, Ebbesmeyer has become known as the scientist to call with questions about any unusual objects found floating in the ocean. He has even started an association of beachcombers and ocean experts, with 500 subscribers from West Africa to New Zealand. They have recorded all lost objects ranging from potatoes to golf gloves.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: How did Ebbesmeyer prove his assumption?\n###"}

{"prompt": "Fear and its companion pain are two of the most useful things that men and animals possess, if they are properly used. If fire did not hurt when it burnt, children would play with it until their hands were burnt away. Similarly, if pain existed but fear didn't, a child would burn himself or herself again and again, because fear would not warn himself or herself to keep away from the fire that had burnt himself or herself before. A really fearless soldier--and some do exist, is not a good soldier because he is soon killed; and a dead soldier is of no use to his army. Fear and pain are therefore two guards without which men and animals might soon die out.\nIn our first sentence we suggested that fear should be properly used. If, for example, you never go out of your house because of the danger of being knocked down and killed in the street by a car, you are letting fear rule you too much. Even in your house you are not absolutely safe: an aeroplane may crash on your house, or ants may eat away some of the beams in your roof so that the latter falls on you, or you may get cancer!\nThe important thing is not to let fear rule you, but instead to use fear as your servant and guide. Fear will warn you of dangers; then you have to decide what action to take.\nIn many cases, you can take quick and successful action to avoid the danger. For example, you see a car coming straight towards you. Fear warns you, you jump out of the way, and all is well.\nIn some cases, however, you decide that there is nothing that you can do to avoid the danger. For example, you can't prevent an aeroplane crashing onto your house. In this case, fear has given you its warning; you have examined it and decided on your course of action, so fear of this particular danger is no longer of any use to you, and you have to try to overcome it.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: What's the writer's suggestion when the danger can't be avoided?\n###"}

From its first application, the word has been definitely connected more with women than with men. It first appeared in 1882, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, mentioning \"a lady manager who was extremely bossy\". As late as 2008, the word appeared in reference to females four times more often than males, claim the Ban Bossy campaigners. \"To me, the reference is always is association with women,\" says Helen Trim, director of Fresh Minds. \"I have three brothers and my family still call me 'bossy' today.\" Her father is the only other family member who could be considered in that way, says Trim, but nobody would ever call him so.\nSome educators recommend that the word should be reclaimed, rather than banned.\"But the thing with'bossy' is that there's an infantile  element to it,\"says Sara Mills, professor at Sheffield University. \"You think of 'bossy' as being like a little kid who's claiming more than he has the right to claim.\"\nIt's not just\"bossy\"under fire.\"Pushy\"is another target. The implication is that women shouldn't present themselves as powerful and confident. Mills suggests, which some women are willing to listen to and accept. Trim points out that many modern female business role models are able to be bosses without being labeled'bossy'.And she rarely,if ever, hears the word used within her company. But she says that the damage may be dome much earlier in a woman's life.\"It does come about from those early teenage years.\"she says.\"I think it's impossible to ban a word, but if people are replacing it with words like'confidence'or'assertiveness',we would all be in a much better place.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: Trim's family still consider her bossy because     .\n###"}

{"prompt": "Rats that eat high levels of a natural sugar, known as fructose, seem to age faster than other rats, and the same could be true for people who eat too much sweet junk food, Israeli researchers said Monday.\nFructose, found naturally in honey and fruit, is used widely in foods ranging from soft drinks to yogurt.But while its sweet taste is popular, the sugar could cause wrinkles and do harm to health, the researchers said.\nDr.Moshe Werman and Boaz Levi fed large amounts of fructose to laboratory rats.They said the fructose-fed rats showed changes in the collagen   of their skin and bones.\nCollagen, a fibrous protein found in connective tissue, bone and cartilage, basically holds the body together.The loss of collagen is what causes loose and deep wrinkles in older people.\nThe process affected, Werman's team said, is known as \"cross linking\".\"Too much cross-linking reduces elasticity   and makes the skin stiff   , and these are the conditions that encourage wrinkled skin,\" Werman said in a statement.He said the same could be true of people, although this has not been shown.\"Americans are eating more and more processed foods such as carbonated drinks, baked foods, canned fruits, jams and dairy products that contain fructose,\" Werman said.\nOther studies have shown that high fructose intake can affect how the body handles glucose and increases insulin   resistance--which can both be important measures of the tendency toward diabetes.\nThe rats Werman worked with were fed much more than the average adult person might eat in a day, which is standard in such experiments.The rats were fed on 12.5 grams fructose per kg (2.2 pounds) of weight every day for a year.To compare, a person weighing 154 pounds (70kg) who drinks a liter of cola consumes about 60 grams of fructose, or 0.8 grams per kg of body weight.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: If a person weighing 70kg takes in 2.4 grams fructose per kg of body weight, then how much cola does he drink?\n###"}

{"prompt": "Kids undergo a large amount of pressure and stress during their school exams, which can often become quite overwhelming (to much) for them. It may be the first experience of stress, at this level, they have ever experienced and therefore quite frightening.

However, it's important to learn how to prepare for life's challenges so that they aren't overwhelming or scary and so that we are able to manage them the best we can.\nHere are some tips you can use during your kids exam time.\nBreak their revision plan down into small parts. Doing this will help transform what once seemed like a huge impossible task into a more manageable one.\nHelp them arrange properly so that the subjects they like the least (perhaps ones that require more time and effort) are worked on first; once they are out of the way, it will help reduce the worry.\nPlan week on week to make sure they are on track. Ticking items of a list each week will help them to feel good about themselves and their progress.\nCreate rewards for all the ticks - a favourite TV programme, a delicious snack, an hour's surfing the Internet, computer games or whatever it was that they enjoy the most. This will encourage them to carry on and make them feel good.\nThink of strategies on how to deal with exams calmly so their anxieties don't _ et the better _ them.\nTalk about times in their lives when they had been successful at something and look at the qualities they used to get them there - determination, persistence, hard work, patience, positivity, dedication - discuss how they can apply these skills to their exams.\nAcknowledge that if they do their best that is good enough.\nEnsure they realize that this period in their lives will pass and that exams are only a temporary time in their lives; nothing can and does last forever.\nEnsure they keep their eye on the prize: enjoying their long summer holiday when the exams are finished; giving them something to look forward to will help to motivate them and provide a positive end in sight.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: Which subjects should be worked on first?\n###"}

{"prompt": "Would the world be more peaceful if women were in charge? A challenging new book by the Harvard University psychologist Steven Pinker says that the answer is \"yes\".\nIn The Better Angels of Our Nature, Pinker presents data showing that human violence, while still very much with us today, has been gradually declining. Moreover, he says, \"over the long sweep of history, women have been and will be a peaceful force. Traditional war is a man's game: tribal women never band together to attack neighboring villages.\" As mothers, women tend to maintain peaceful conditions in which to bring up their children.\nSkeptics immediately reply that women have not made war simply because they have rarely been in power. If they were empowered as leaders, the disorder of the world would force them to make the same warlike decisions that men do. Margaret Thatcher,Golda Meir, and Indira Gandhi were powerful women; all of them led their countries to war.\nBut it is also true that these women rose to leadership by playing according to the political rules of \"a man's world.\" It was their success consistent with male values that enabled their rise to leadership in the first place. In a world in which women were in the majority of leadership positions, they might behave differently in power.\nSo we are left with the broader question: does gender really matter in leadership? In terms of traditional opinion, various psychological studies show that men tend towards the hard power of command, while women are cooperative and naturally understand the soft power of attraction and persuasion.\nThe key choices about war and peace in our future will depend not on gender, but on how leaders combine hard and soft power skills to produce smart policies. Both men and women will make those decisions.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: How did these women rise to leadership?\n###"}

{"prompt": "New research has shown that you might not just be feeling blue; you may also be seeing it differently. Your mood may affect how you see the world around you, according to a new study. A team of researchers has proved that sadness could have an effect on the way we see colors.\nThe team, led by psychology researcher Christopher Thorstenson of the University of Rochester, found that people who had a sad mood were less accurate in identifying colors on the blue-yellow axis  , compared to people who weren't feeling sad.\n\"We were already deeply familiar with how often people use color terms to describe common phenomena, like mood, even when these concepts seem unrelated,\" Thorstenson said in a statement. \"We thought maybe a reason why these metaphors   appear was that there really was a connection between mood and identifying colors in a different way.\"\nThorstenson and his team are not the first to identify a link between a depressed mood and a difference in recognition. In 2010, Emanuel Bubl and his team at Albert Ludwigs University Freiburg in Germany first proved a link between mood and identifying colors. This was supported by a 2013 paper by Johnson Fam of the University of Singapore.\nThe team conducted two studies. In the first, 127 participants were chosen _ to watch one of two video clips, which had been proved in previous studies to feel either sadness or amusement. They didn't do that in a specific order. The entire group was then tasked with identifying the colors in 48 continued color changes. The group that had been shown the sad clip was measurably worse at identifying colors along the blue-yellow axis.\nFor the second study, 130 participants were randomly assigned to watch either a sad clip or a neutral   one. The sadness group showed reduced ability to identify colors along the blue-yellow axis than the neutral group.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: Who were the first to find out the link between mood and identifying colours?\n###"}
{"prompt": "Much of the water we use comes from snow. Melting snow provides water for rivers, electric power centers and agricultural crops. In the western United States, mountain snow provides up to 75% of all surface water supplies.\nSnowfall helps to protect plants and some wild animals from cold, winter weather. Fresh snow is made largely of air trapped among the snow crystals. Because the air has trouble moving, the movement of heat is greatly reduced.\nSnow also is known to influence the movement of sound waves. When there is fresh snow on the ground, the surface of the snow takes in, or absorbs, sound waves. However, snow can become hard and flat as it becomes older or if there have been strong winds. Then the snow's surface will help to send back sound waves. Under these conditions, sounds may seem clearer and travel farther.\nGenerally, the color of snow and ice appears white. This is because the light we see from the sun is white. Most natural materials take in some sunlight. This gives them their color. However, when light travels from air to snow, some light is sent back, or reflected. Snow crystals have many surfaces to reflect sunlight. Yet the snow does take in a little sunlight. It is this light that gives snow its white appearance.\nSometimes, snow or ice may appear to be blue. The blue light is the product of a long travel path through the snow or ice. In simple terms, think of snow or ice as a filter. A filter is designed to reject some substances, while permitting others to pass through. In the case of snow, all the light makes it through if the snow is only a centimeter thick. If it is a meter or more thick, however, blue light often can be seen.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: Why does snowfall help to protect plants from cold?\n###"}
{"prompt": "Do you ever wonder why the English have one word for some animals and a different one for their meat? Why do they use pig and pork, cow and beef, and sheep and mutton? To find it out, we have to go back to 1066, when the Norman French invaded England and put a French king on the English throne  , which not only changed the government but also changed the language. French became the language of the upper classes of society. And it remained that way for 300 years. Only these high society people could afford to eat meat. As a result, French words like porc (pork) and beouf (beef) came into the English language. However, poor English farmers raised the animals. So the English language _ the words pig and cow from the Native Anglo-Saxon.\nThe Norman French added about 10,000 French words to the English language. Seventy-five percent of them are still in use today.\nIn French grammar, nouns have either a male or female gender  , so adjectives   take different forms for each. English has only one adjective that does this, and it came from French. The word \"blond\" describes someone with light-colored hair. \"Blond\" is used for men, and \"blonde\" describes women. And they are also nouns.\nSome French words that entered the English language have taken on completely different meanings. The French phrase \"a la mode\" means \"in style\". In English, the phrase means \"with the ice cream\". Someone must have decided something eaten with ice cream was in style!\nNow, as you learn English, you're on your way to learning French!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: Why does an English speaker find French easy to learn?\n###"}

{"prompt": "As my dad unwrapped  the new bicycle helmet that I got him for his birthday, I realized that a number of people ride their bicycles every day without the protection of a helmet.\nDue to cold winters across the country, riding has become increasingly dangerous as many roads have potholes and are torn-up  . Not everyone realizes that there are laws requiring the wearing of helmets in many places.\nWhere I live, there has been a law in place since October 1, 1992 stating that cyclists of all ages are required to wear helmets. Unfortunately, accidents can happen to the best of riders. My dad has been a cyclist for many years, and he often rides around my county and to Rockland Lake State Park.\nOne afternoon, as he was just entering the park, he lost control of his bicycle and flew off and landed on a nearby patch of grass, breaking his helmet into pieces and losing consciousness . When he was just awakening, a lovely couple found him and brought him back to our house, where he attempted to recap the events leading up to his fall. Later that day, a CAT scan showed that he had a concussion  . That evening, while my dad was showing me the pieces of his broken helmet, _ .\nIf he had not worn his helmet, he probably would have cracked his skull and perhaps died.

{"prompt": "My name is Toby. I'm eighty-three years old now. I once knew the greatest man in England. William Shakespeare was his name. I first met William near a big field of apple trees in the town named Stratford in October, 1579. He told me he was 15 years old. He was two years older than me. He had a sister, Joan, and two younger brothers, Gilbert and Richard. And the next year he had another brother, Edmund. After William's parents died, he and his sister lived with his mother's brother. I became his friend from that day until he died. We met nearly every day. We were friends for thirty years.\nI once worked with him in the theatre, through the good times and the bad times. William was good at acting. He could make all kinds of people pleased. By 1592, he became very famous. He was always busy day and night. I don't know when he slept. He not only acted in plays, but also wrote his own plays. In his whole life, William wrote 37 plays in all. He was the best  _ in England.\nHe wrote a play about love in 1595. It was Romeo and Juliet. He once used my name, Toby, in his play--Twelfth Night. In this play, Sir Toby Belch was a big fat man, who liked drinking too much and having a good time. Queen Elizabeth the First watched this play on the 6thof January, 1601. She liked it.\nWilliam Shakespeare is dead now, of course. He has been dead for more than thirty years. There's no singing, no dancing, no plays. It isn't like that in my young days.

{"prompt": "Since we are social beings, the quality of our lives depends in large measure on our interpersonal  relationships. One strength of the human condition is our possibility to give and receive support from one another under stressful conditions. Social support makes up of the exchange of resources among people based on their interpersonal ties. Those of us with strong support systems appear better able to deal with major life changes and daily problems. People with strong social ties live longer and have better health than those without such ties. Studies over types of illnesses, from depression to heart disease, show that the presence of social support helps people defend themselves against illness, and the absence of such support makes poor health more likely.\nSocial support cushions  stress in a number of ways. First, friends, relatives and co-workers may let us know that they value us. Our self-respect is strengthened when we feel accepted by others in spite of our faults and difficulties. Second, other people often provide us with informational support. They help us to define and understand our problems and find solutions to them. Third, we typically find social companionship supportive. Taking part in free-time activities with others helps us to meet our social needs while at the same time distracting   us from our worries and troubles. Finally, other people may give us instrumental support money aid, material resources, and needed services - that reduces stress by helping us resolve and deal with our problems.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: What is the subject discussed in the text?\n###"}

Temperatures there are rising faster than anywhere else on Earth. As a result, the ice and snow in these regions are melting  at record-setting rates.

Uncle Miguel and Aunt Esperanza thought of the good jobs they would get. Grandmother and Grandfather told him what a lucky boy he was to come to this wonderful city. But Carlos was lonely. The city looked big, cold and dirty to him.\nThey lived in an apartment in Manhattan. There were stores and cinemas close to their home. But Carlos didn't want these things. He loved his home in the country in Puerto Rico; he loved the green fields, the hot sun, and the lovely beaches.\nHe didn't want to go to school because it made him think of his friends at home. And he didn't want to learn a new language that he could never describe the world as beautifully as his own.\nHe began to go the dock , because this made him feel closer to Puerto Rico. He sat down and watched the ships. He would often find a man also sitting there looking at the sea.

{"prompt": "Eyesight problems are common among all ages and if they are left untreated, they can cause serious headaches or other problems. The good news is that most eyesight problems can easily be sorted out by wearing glasses.\nRegular eye tests are important for everyone. Children and teenagers, under the age of 16 and up to the age of 19 for those full-time education, have the right to have eye tests for free in Britain. As the eye test is free, there's no excuse for not having a regular eye test. Doctors suggest that it's better to have an eye test about once a year.\nWearing glasses isn't always regarded as all that cool and teens who suddenly need to wear glasses may find it difficult to accept. If they've grown up wearing glasses, then they may be more used to it. However, if your eyes are in poor health, not wearing glasses can put even more pressure on your eyes and could make them even worse.\nThankfully, the days of little choice of glasses frames   for teenagers are gone and there's now a wide selection of frames. If a teen does need to wear glasses, then it's good to let him or her choose the type, as he or she will be able to choose something he or she feels comfortable.

As the saying goes\" When in Rome, do as the Romans do\", English learners should know what the proper table manners are in western countries if invited to a dinner party. The followings are some suggestions that may be helpful to you.\nThe first important thing you need to know is when to begin eating. Before dinner, the hostess usually serves guests first and herself last. So do not eat as soon as you are served but wait until the hostess has also been served and has picked up her fork as the signal to begin. But at a large dinner party where there are many guests, the hostess may ask everyone to begin eating as soon as they are served. If you want to talk while eating, your mouth should certainly not be full of food because it is considered very bad manners. But it is possible to speak with a little food in the mouth. When you have to answer a question, naturally you must wait until the food in your mouth is eaten.\nWhen a dish is passed to you with a fork in the plate, you should use it to take your food. Do not take too much at a time and make sure that the other guests can have enough food.\nAnyway, good table manners are very important and they are not so simple as we thought.

{"prompt": "Most people think of zoos as safe heavens for animals, where problems such as difficulty finding food and avoiding predators   don't exist. Therefore, animals in zoos should live to a ripe old age.\nBut that may not be true for the largest land animals on earth. Scientists have known that elephants in zoos often suffer from poor health. They develop diseases and they are even unable to have babies.\nTo learn more about how captivity   affects elephants, a team of international scientists compared the lifespans   of the zoo-born elephants with the lifespans of thousands of wild elephants. They also compared some Asian elephants living in zoos with some Asian elephants which work in logging camp  , over almost the same time period.\nThe team found that elephants born in zoos lived an average of 16.9 years, but elephants that died of natural causes lived an average of 56 years. Asian elephants followed a similar pattern. In zoos, they lived 18.9 years, while those in the logging camp lived 41.7 years.\nScientists don't yet know why wild elephants seem to live so much better than their zoo-raised counterparts  . Georgia Mason, a biologist at the University of Guelph in Canada, who led the study, thinks stress and obesity   may be to blame. Zoo elephants don't get the same kind of exercise they would in the wild.

It says that many people lie about having read Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, Fyodor Dostoevsky(I haven't read him, but haven't lied about it either )and Herman Melville.\nAsked why they lied, the most common reason was to \"impress\" someone they were speaking to.

Older relatives, English teachers and the media always praise him. But when you actually take the time to read The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, you find that his work is more wonderful than you could've ever imagined.\nThe novel describes a young boy named Tom Sawyer growing up in a small town along the Mississippi River. He explores the countryside on a riverboat with his friends, falls in love with girls, starts secret clubs and searches for treasure. Twain's idea of childhood is magical - a time of imagination, wonder and, of course, adventure.\nMore importantly, through the eyes of Tom Sawyer, Twain cleverly makes fun of US culture. For example, Tom hates going to church, and Twain uses scenes of Tom there to _ religion   and its old traditions. \"Often, the less there is to justify a traditional custom, the harder it is to get rid of it,\" he writes in one chapter.\nTwain's writing is full of these kinds of critical   points about culture and politics. That's why he is so loved in the US - he wasn't afraid to state his opinions, and he did so clearly. For instance, Twain didn't like US wars abroad. In 1900, after the US invaded   the Philippines, Twain wrote in a newspaper article: \"We do not intend to free, but to subjugate   the people of the Philippines... We have gone there to conquer.\" He also believed strongly in women's right to vote in elections and gave a famous speech on the subject, called \"Votes for Women\", in 1901.\n\"Tom was a glittering hero once more - the pet of the old, the envy of the young,\" Twain writes in Tom Sawyer.

{"prompt": "If you are planning to learn a foreign language, here are some suggestions about language learning. I hope these suggestions can help improve your learning of a foreign language\nTry to set aside some time every day for your study when your brain is at the most time for receiving information. It's better to study for 30 minutes every day than for 3 hours once a week. If you can spare two or three hours a day, break them up into some periods to avoid brain getting tired.\nGo over each lesson several times, perhaps once in the morning, once in the evening and once several days later. Give your brain time to understand the material, but the break between periods of study shouldn't be too long, or you will forget most of what you've learned.\nMake sure you're comfortable with the bases of the language before learning the more advanced knowledge. Without full understanding of basic knowledge such as words pronunciation and spelling, you'll find it very difficult to learn more.\nSetting proper targets is a good way to encourage yourself. You could set yourself a time limit or aim for a certain level.\nOnce you have mastered the bases of the language, learn to apply them to the things that you're interested in. In this way you are more likely to remember the words, phrases and grammatical constructions you meet.\nYou will find that at times you're making rapid progress, while sometimes you seem to stand still or even go backwards. This is normal when learning a language, so don't be discouraged.\nMaking mistakes in a foreign language is nothing to worry about. What matters is getting your message across, not whether you use all the right words, tenses, cases, etc. If you cannot think of the exact words, try using other ones.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: What is the best time plan for studying a foreign language ?\n###"}

{"prompt": "\"Image is everything.\" An entire industry has been built upon the assumption that image is everything, but when it comes down to it, an appealing image is not enough.If there is no substance  behind the image, the product, service or person will fail eventually.\nFirst of all, one should consider how important image is in the selling of products and services.Advertising agencies have raised the art of creating an image to a state of near perfection.Public concept of that product or service is certainly managed by the images created by the advertising agencies.But if the product or service does not live up to the image that was created, the customer will be very dissatisfied and possibly ask for their money back.For example, the Arthur Andersen accounting firm had spent decades building up an image of trustworthiness.But the recent scandal   showed that behind that image, it cheated in business practices.Despite the previous positive image, the firm is being accused of criminal actions and it will probably not survive as a business unit.Although the image had been nearly perfect, the reality behind the image has led to the downfall of the world famous accounting firm.\nSimilarly, personal advisers can build up a public image for politicians and movie stars.Putting out positive news releases, making sure that only the best photographs are published, and ensuring that the person is seen in all the right places can build up a very positive image in the view of the general commons.But once again, history is filled with examples of both politicians and movie stars that fell from grace like the story of the Hollywood actor giving in to the pressures of fame and fortune.With people, just as with products and services, image is certainly important, but without positive substance behind the image, failure is close.\nTo summarize, it is clear that an appealing image is extremely important to success, whether that image is related to selling a product or service or to the \"selling\" of a person.But image is only half of the equation.What lies behind that image is every bit as important as the image itself ---- the person or product must deliver on that image or there is little chance for long-term success.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: Why did some famous people fall from grace?\n###"}

After breakfast we had arranged, as a surprise, to hire a car and take her for a beautiful drive in the country. Mother was rarely able to have a treat like that, because she was busy in the house nearly all the time.\nBut on the very morning of the day, we changed the plan a little, because it occurred to Father that it would be even better to take Mother fishing. As the car was hired and paid for, we might as well use it to drive up into the hills where the streams are. As Father said, if you just go driving without object, you have a sense of aimlessness, but if you are going to fish there is a definite purpose that heightens the enjoyment.\nSo we all felt it would be nicer for Mother to have a definite purpose . Father had just got a fishing rod the day before, which he said mother could use if she wanted to. Only Mother said she would much rather watch him fish than try to fish herself.\nSo we got her to make up a sandwich lunch in case we got hungry, though we were to come home again to a big festive dinner.\nWell, when the car came to the door, it turned out that there was not as much space in it as we had supposed. It was plain that we couldn't all get in.\nFather said that he could just stay home and put in the time working in the garden. He said that there was a lot of rough dirty work that he could do, like digging a trench for the garbage, which would save hiring a man, and so he said that he'd stay home; he said that we were not to let the fact that he had not had a real holiday for three years stand in our way. He wanted us to go right ahead and not to mind him.\nBut of course we all felt that it would never do to let Father stay home, especially as we knew he would make trouble if he did. The two girls, Anne and Mary, would have stayed and helped the maid get dinner, only it seemed such a pity,for the two girls were eager to show their new hats on a lovely day like this.

{"prompt": "Are you preparing for a big test? If so, you may want to play some basketball in between hitting the books. Doctors are starting to find more and more information that suggests a connection between exercise and brain development. Judy Cameron, a scientist at Oregon Health and Oregon Health and Science University, studies brain development. According to her research, it seems that exercise can make blood vessels , including those in the brain, stronger and more fully developed. Dr. Cameron claims this allows people who exercise to concentrate better. As she says, \"While we already know that exercise is good for the heart, exercise can really cause physical changes in the brain.\"\nThe effects of exercise on brain development can even be seen in babies. Babies who do activities that require a lot of movement and physical activity show greater brain development than babies who are less physically active. With babies, even a little movement can show big results. Margaret Barnes, a pediatrician , believes in the importance of exercise. She thinks that many learning disabilities that children have in elementary school or high school can be traced back to a lack of movement as babies. \"Babies need movement that stimulates their five senses. They need to establish a connection between motion and memory. In this way, as they get older, children will begin to associate physical activity with higher learning,\" says Margaret.\nOlder people can beef up their brains as well. Scientists from 11 universities studied a group of seniors ranging in age from seventy to seventy-nine. Their study showed a short-term memory increase of up to 40 percent after exercising just three hours a week. The exercise does not have to be very difficult, but it does have to increase the heart rate. Also, just like the motion for infants  , exercise for older people should involve some complexity. Learning some new skills or motions, such as with yoga or tai-chi, helps to open up memory paths in the brain that may not have been used for a long time.\nFor most people, any type of physical activity that increases the heart rate is helpful. The main goal is to increase the brain's flow of blood. And your brain can benefit from as little as three hours of exercise a week.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: According to the reading, what is the connection between exercise and brain development?\n###"}

Signals are then sent from the trousers to a computer to show the process.\nTom Martin also says, \"E-textiles are a way for us to build wearable computers that look like normal clothing and can fit in fully with the environment.\"\nResearchers also hope wearable computers will help save lives. \"We will be able to tell what activity a person is doing. That sort of information is highly valuable when we're trying to monitor someone with a long-term illness such as heart disease,\" Jones says. Monitoring your every step is something that clever clothing can do a little easier. Researchers plan on developing more smart clothes to integrate computers into shirts, hats and gloves.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: How will smart clothes be able to know the wearer's every movement?\n###"}
{"prompt": "I am a music store owner. One day, when I was cleaning the instruments in my store, I saw an old man come in. His short steps dragged on the carpet. \"Is 77 too old to learn the banjo  ?\" he asked.\n\"You can learn to play it well,\" I replied, holding back my doubts. My mind told me I was giving false encouragement. I reached the instructor's schedule and gave the rates, the available time and the additional information that he would need. To my surprise and delight, the old man, Carl, began banjo lessons three days later with my most patient teacher.\nWith nothing to do at home but practice, Carl made surprising progress. After breakfast he practiced for his required half hour. While waiting for lunch he picked up his banjo again for just a couple of minutes. Since TV was difficult for him to see and hear, he often played the banjo in the evenings. Carl was always early for lessons so it was a surprise that he didn't arrive one Tuesday.\nThe next morning I listened to the answering machine with sadness. \"Carl's in hospital,\" the voice recorded.\nTwo months later, I shared the newspaper _ with the banjo teacher. We both shed tears for a surprisingly clever banjo student.\nSeveral months later, a woman came into the store carrying a plant. \"This is for Carl's banjo teacher,\" she said. \"I'm his wife, Mary.\"\n\"Why did Carl want to play the banjo?\" I asked. Mary took a deep breath and let it out slowly. \"Carl was at some show when he was 10 years old. He came close to the stage to watch the performers.

{"prompt": "Eleven-year-old Evan Green doesn't want to save just one tree-he wants to save a whole rainforest!\nIn the Redwood City, Calif, a boy started a group called the Red Dragon Conservation Team four years ago to do just that. So far, the team's members have raised $4,500. That's enough to purchase and protect more than 16 acres of rainforest in Costa Rica through the Center for Ecosystem survival.\nEvery year, thousands of square miles of rainforest are destroyed worldwide. Logging and farming are mostly likely to blame, scientists say. The loss is terrible news for animals and people. Even though rainforests cover less than 2 percent of the earth, they are home to half the world's plants and animals. Rainforests also provide water and help control the earth's climate.\nEvan's work to save the rainforests recently earned him a Barron prize for Young Heroes. The prizes are given to children or teenagers who have made a positive difference in the world. Evan's goal is \"to save enough rainforests to last forever\". He won't have to do it alone. His actions have already inspired other kids to chip in. One girl asked for donations instead of presents on her birthday. She raised $850. Other kids are starting their own conservation teams.\nEvan says everyone can help the planet-even by taking small steps such as recycling. He and his family try to make a difference every day. \"We recycle, we try to limit our garbage... we've been walking a little more, and we buy local food,\" Evan said.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: How much does it cost to buy and protect an acre of rainforest in Costa Rica?\n###"}

{"prompt": "I moved into a new house in July. Since then I have met a few of my neighbors who are very nice people. For Christmas, I thought I would do something nice for each of the neighbors I know. There were nine neighbors whom I knew by name or spoke with often when I was out in my yard. I knew which houses they lived in.\nI decided to add one more to my list. This lady I decided to add lives down the street from me. I meet her every morning walking to work as I drive down the street. She always smiles to me. But I had no idea who she was and which house she lived in.\nI planned to make small fruit baskets and leave them on my neighbor's front porches  on Christmas Eve. I signed the cards: \"Happy Holidays from 5104 Northumberland Road.\"\nI saved the last for the friendly lady. I finally decided on a house where I met her each morning and guessed that it was hers.\nMy neighbors really appreciated the baskets and would tell me as they saw me in the yard or they would call, and a couple even came by to thank me.\nThis morning I found a small note in the mailbox. It was addressed simply: Resident, 5104 Northumberland Road.\nThe Thank You card really caught me by surprise. I opened it and read the message, \"Thank you for the lovely fruit basket you left on our porch. It was very thoughtful. Richard Kelly passed away last week. He talked a lot about how nice it was that someone remembered him in his time of illness. He really appreciated it.\"\nI had no idea who Richard Kelly was and that he had been seriously ill. I had left that nice lady's basket on his porch by mistake. I wanted to say sorry, but that would be wrong. I believe that Mr. Kelly was meant to have that basket because he was dying. I hate that the nice lady did not get to receive a fruit basket on Christmas, but I believe if she knew what had happened, she would be happy. I feel pleased to have helped Richard Kelly's last days be more cheerful.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: Where did the friendly lady live?\n###"}
{"prompt": "Have you ever wondered how a popular food or dessert was first created? Read on and find out about several of them.\nChewing gum--Although ancient Greeks,Mayans,and early American settlers chewed sap from trees, the first commercial chewing gum was made and sold by John B. Curtis in 1848. In 1850, Curtis began selling flavored gums.\nPizza--In Italy in the early 1700s, flat breads, called pizzas, were made without toppings.These tasty,filling breads were sold to the poor in Naples.When Maria Carolina, the queen of Naples, tasted one, she persuaded her husband, King Ferdinand IV, to allow this peasant dish to be made in the royal kitchen.Almost 200 years later,during her travels around the country, Italy's queen Margherita saw Italian peasants eating pizza breads.She had a taste and fell in love with pizza. She ordered the most famous pizza cook of the day, Raffaele Esposito, to create for her a pizza made of tomato, basil, and cheese to look like the color1s of the Italian flag. This remains the basis of the American version of the pizza.\nThe ice-cream-cone--In 1904, Italo Marchiony got a patent  to produce ice-cream cones. The same year at the ST. Louis World's Fair, a Syrian waffle  seller Ernest Hamwi heard that a nearby ice-cream seller had run out of dishes to serve his cream. Hamwi rolled some of his waffles into a cone  shape and offered them to his neighbor, who put ice-cream in the cones and sold them. This first fully eatable, portable  treat was a hit with customers immediately.\nM&Ms--During the Spanish Civil War of the 1930s, Forrest Mars, Sr., saw soldiers eating pieces of chocolate covered with a hard sugary coating, which kept the chocolate from melting in the sun. Using this idea, Mars developed M&Ms in 1941.

This vast lake had a unique reputation as being the best fishing and tourist resort.\nWith the boat undocked and the gear and luggage stored beneath the security of the seats, we set off into the setting sun at 8:30.\nUnlike my parents , I had never been on a fishing boat before and was captivated  by the speed and grace in which it traveled through the waves. The lake was deserted as the sky began to darken and looked more threatening by the minute.\nSuddenly the boat hit something with such a force that we all fell over in our seats. The whole boat shook for a moment, before water started to trickle slowly over stern. My father went to the back and after many attempts to start the engine, he began to look very worried. The water was now rushing in at a much faster rate, tipping the boat at an awkward angle.\nWe tried our best to hold on to something. The worst was yet to come. With our life jackets secured and fastened, we waited as the boat sank deeper into the water. We were soon immersed in the chilly depths. The biting cold was more terrifying than anyone could imagine.\nMy parents, who were dressed in floater jackets, clung desperately to each other, trying to keep their heads above water. I, on the other hand, wasn't so fortunate. A strong gust of wind blew briskly across the lake, bringing with it, torrential rain and threatening thunderstorms. The strong waves carried me on into the night. The waves continued to pound violently, forcing me underwater.\nThe following morning a fisherman found us. By that time, our body temperatures were twenty-four degrees, which meant we were nearly dead. Later investigation showed that we had been in the water for fifteen hours.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: What is the reason which caused the accident?\n###"}

{"prompt": "Have you ever heard the saying \"All roads lead to Rome\"? At one time, this was pretty much true. During the Roman Empire, lots of roads were built in order to move armies, send messages by courier  , and make trade easier. This construction work went on for five centuries! If all the roads built during the Roman Empire were put together end to end, they would circle the equator twice.\nThe network of Roman roads was begun in 312 BC. It was demanded that the roads be built strong so that they would not fall down. Roman soldiers, supervised   by engineers, laid down the roads in a special pattern of layers. The first layer was made of sand. Next, the builders added rocks and rubble. On top of these materials came gravel. On this solid foundation, the road builders placed paving stones.\nAlso, Roman roads were cambered. This means that they were built higher in the middle than on the edges, allowing rainwater to run off, which prevented flooding. We use the same technique in building roads today. The Romans also laid out roads over hills when necessary, setting them down in a zigzag pattern to make the road rise gradually.\nAll Roman roads had milestones  , placed every thousands paces (a Roman mile). The milestones told when the road was built, who was emperor at the time, the road's destination, how far the traveler was from the destination, and how many miles had been traveled since the beginning of the road. This information was a great help to travelers.\nBecause of their excellence in construction, it really is no surprise that many parts of Roman road still exist today. These roadways are one of the most impressive accomplishments of the Roman Empire.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: What information can you find on the milestones?\n###"}

It also encourages people to buy food from local businesses, rather than large supermarkets.\nThe movement began in 1986. at that time, McDonald's wanted to open a restaurant in the centre of Rome (Italy). Food writer Carlo Perini, along with others, was against this. So, the Slow Food Organization was born. Today, it has overt 100,00 members in 132 countries. And its symbol is one of the world's slowest moving creatures, the snail. The organization's website explains, \"The snail was chosen because it moves slowly, and calmly eats its way through life.\"\nBut Slow Food isn't just about the food we eat. It's also about how we eat it. Slow foodies say that in our fast - food world with very little time, we've forgotten that eating should be a social activity. They believe families should eat together and talk, rather than watch TV with their dinner while sitting in front of it. In fact, research has shown that if children grow up in a family that eats together at the table, they are more likely to do well in school, and less likely to have behavioral problems or devel op eating disorders.\nAnd there's more! Slow Food has sparked an entire Slow Food Movement. This encourages people to slow down the pace of their busy lives. And now, within the movement, there's Slow Money, Slow Travel, Slow Parenting, Slow Art and Slow Media, among many others. In 1999 The World Institute of Slowness was formed. One of the Institute's slogans is a quotation by the famous American actress Mae West. She said, \"Everything worth doing in life, is worth doing slowly.\" Do you agree? No need to answer straight away. Have a long hard think about it. Take your time. And get back to us when you can.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: Why did people start the Slow Food Movement?\n###"}

{"prompt": "For most people, Christmas is a time to relax in the company of family and friends. But for Santa Claus, and the thousands of fake Santas who impersonate  him every year, the Christmas season is time to get to work.\nAlthough  Santa Claus waits until Christmas Eve to take his famous sleigh   ride, Santa impersonators can be found at shopping malls around America throughout the six weeks leading up to December 25. \"When you see Santa talking with kids at your local mall, that's when you know Christmas really is on the way,\" says Mary Lewine of New York City.\nWith the excitement of Christmas, people often forget about the real people behind the red robes   and white beards, but being a mall Santa. is a tough job. \"There is more to it than just sitting in a chair. There is more to it than just a red suit,\" said Timothy Connaghan, who has worked as a Santa for.38 years. \"Children can really put the wear and tear on you.\"\nA recent survey showed some of the challenges that mall Santas face every year. About 90 percent of Santas claimed that children pulled their beards to see if they were real, and 60 percent said that up to ten kids cough or sneeze on them every day. Even more disturbing, one-third of the Santas admit to having children wet themselves while sitting on their laps.\nSo why would anyone take this job? For Ben Brauch, a retired high school teacher who has worked as a Santa for the last six years, the answer is simple-the children. \"I see maybe 12,000 kids in a six-week period.\nIt's hard work, but it's worth it because you get to play with kids.\" In fact, Brauch loves his job so much that he keeps his white beard long all year.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: Why does Ben Brauch love his job of Santa impersonator?\n###"}

{"prompt": "Copenhagen, one of the world's most bicycle-friendly cities, has begun turning its extensive network of cycle paths into bike highways in an effort to push more commuters   to leave their cars at home.\nConsidered one of Europe's two \"bicycle capitals\" along with Amsterdam, Copenhagen counts more bicycles than people and cycling is so popular that its numerous bike paths can become jammed. Two-wheeler traffic jams are especially regular on the main Noerrebrogade thoroughfare   used by around 36,000 cyclists a day. \"You have to elbow your way to go forward and some cyclists aren't always thoughtful,\" complains 22-year-old university student Lea Bresell.\nThe creation of bike highways \"comes right on time\", says Danish Cyclist Federation spokesman Frits Bredal. \"Copenhagen's roads are overloaded with people who want to ride their bicycles in all kinds of weather,\" he says. If in the 1960s Danes viewed the car as the symbol of freedom, the bicycle has assumed that role today, Bredal says. \"It's a means of transportation used by all social classes, and even politicians ride bikes,\" he says.\nIt is on crowded Noerrebrogade -- the busiest bicycle street in Europe -- that city planners have decided to build the first of Copenhagen's environmentally friendly streets. The jammed bike paths will be widened up to four meters on either side of the road, which will itself be reserved for bikes only. The idea is to make Noerrebrogade \"Europe's great cycling street\", says Andreas Roehl, the Copenhagen city's bicycle program manager who is also known as \"Mister Bike\". But Roehl is not content with making life easier for Copenhagen's inner city cyclists: He wants to get suburbanites out of their cars and onto two wheels as well. His goal is to increase the percentage of suburban commuters cycling to and from the city from the 33 percent it is today to more than 50 percent by 2015. Within the city, 55 percent of all commuters already travel by bike.\nAlready Copenhagen stands out among other European capitals for its cycling infrastructure, counting more than 390 kilometers of bike paths.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: How do suburban commuters travel to and from the city in Copenhagen at present?\n###"}

This was the first time I'd ever seen my mom cry; my mom, who was always so strong and was there to encourage me through the roughest times, was now crying, and I was the reason for it. Finding my voice, I tentatively asked, \"Why are you crying?\"\nShe looked at me and answered exactly what I was afraid to hear, \"I hate to see you hurting yourself.\" So it was my fault. I had put those tears in her eyes. I had filled her with pain, with helplessness and with sadness.\nI'll never forget her pained expression. It forced me to realize how shortsighted and close-minded I'd been.

She passed out sheets of construction paper while continuing, \"The first prize is ten dollars. You just have to make sure that the words on the blackboard appear somewhere on your poster. \"\nWe studied the board carefully. Some of us looked with one eye and held up certain colors against the blackboard, rocking the sheets to the right or left while we _ our designs. Others twisted their hair around their fingers or chewed their erasers while deep in thought. We had plans for that ten-dollar grand prize, each and every one of us. I'm going to spend mine on candies, one hopeful would announce, while another practiced looking serious, wise and rich.\nEveryone in the class made a poster. Some of us used parts of those fancy paper napkins, while others used nothing but colored construction paper. Some of us used big designs, and some of us preferred to gather our art tidily down in one corner of our poster and let the space draw the viewer's attention to it. Some of us would wander past the good students' desks and then return to our own projects with a growing sense of hopelessness. It was yet another grown-up trick of the sort they seemed especially fond of, making all of us believe we had a fair chance, and then always--always--rewarding the same old winners.\nI believe I drew a sailboat, but I can't say that with any certainty. I made it. I admired it. I determined it to be the very best of all of the posters I had seen, and then I turned it in.\nMinutes passed. No one came along to give me the grand prize, and then someone distracted  me, and I probably never would have thought about that poster again.\nI was still sitting at my desk, thinking, What poster?

For Andrew Agassi, maturing in the spotlight of international tennis competition was even harder.\nOn September 3, the American tennis player said a tearful goodbye to his 21-year career after a third-round defeat in the US Open. The 36-year-old tried his best, but was unable to keep up with German Benjamin Becker, _ \n\"The scoreboard said I lost today, but what the scoreboard doesn't say is what I've found,\" Agassi said to the fans. \"I have found inspiration and you willed me to succeed.\" It was an emotional speech at the end of a long career.\nAgassi hated tennis as a teenager as much as he loves it now. His father made him play when he was a child. He got bored, and became a rebel . The strict training that his father pushed upon him got in the way of his wild lifestyle. He grew hair long, wore colorful clothes and spat at a judge. Over the years, he has made bad jokes during news conferences. Asked what he would say to his 17-year-old self, Agassi answered, \"I would say, I understand you a lot more than I want to be you.\"\nThe turning point in Agassi's career came in 1992 when he unexpectedly won his first Grand Slam  at Wimbledon. It was the first time Agassi understood what real champions finally understand: winning is a test of courage and not just power, it's a marathon, not a sprint .\nAnd what a marathon Agassi was about to begin. He cut his long hair, got fitter and tightened up emotionally. On the court, he ranked No. 1 for almost two years. His lowest point came in 1997 when his ranking dropped to No. 141.

{"prompt": "What will higher education look like in 2050? That was the question addressed Tuesday night by Michael Crow, president of Arizona State University.\n\"We're at the end of the fourth wave of change in higher education,\" Crow began, arguing that research universities followed the initial establishment of higher education, public colleges, and land-grant schools in the timeline of America.\nIn less than a half-century, he said, global market competition will be at its fastest rates of change ever, with several multitrillion-dollar economies worldwide. According to a recent projection, the nation's population could reach 435 million, with a large percentage of those residents economically disadvantaged. In addition, climate change will be \"meaningfully uncontrollable\" in many parts of the world.\nThe everyday trends seen today, such as declining performance of students at all levels, particularly in math and science, and declining wages and employment among the less educated, will only continue, Crow maintained, and are, to say the least, not contributing to fulfilling the dream of climbing the social ladder mobility, quality of life, sustainable environment, and longer life spans that most Americans share.\n\"How is it that we can have these great research universities and have negative-trending outcomes?\" Crow said in a talk \"I hold the universities accountable. ... We are part of the problem.\"\nAmong the \"things that we do that make the things that we teach less learnable,\" Crow said, are the strict separation of disciplines, academic rigidity, and conservatism, the desire of universities to imitate schools at the top of the social ranks, and the lack of the computer system ability that would allow a large number of students to be educated for a small amount of money.\nSince 2002, when Crow started being in charge at Arizona State -- which he calls the \"new American university\" -- he has led more than three dozen initiatives that aim to make the school \"inclusive, scalable, fast, adaptive, challenge-focused, and willing to take risks.\"\nAmong those initiatives were a restructuring of the engineering and life sciences schools to create more linkages between disciplines; the launch of the School of Earth and Space Exploration and the School of Sustainability; the start of a Teachers College to address K-12 performance and increase the status of the Education Department at the university; and broadened access, increasing the freshman class size by 42 percent and the enrollment of students living below the poverty line by 500 percent.\nUniversities must start, Crow noted, \"by becoming self-reflective _ figuring out what we have and what we actually need instead of what legend tells us we have to be.\" Research universities today have \"run their course,\" he added. \"Now is the time for variety.\"\nDuring a discussion afterward, Crow clarified and expanded on some of his points. He discussed, for example, the school's distance-learning program. \"Nearly 40 percent of undergraduates are taking at least one course online,\" he said, which helps the school to keep costs down while advancing interactive learning technologies.\nHe said that Arizona State is working to increase the transfer and completion rates of community-college students, of whom only about 15 percent, historically, complete their later degrees. \"We've built a system that will allow them to track into universities,\" particularly where \"culturally complex barriers\" beyond finances limit even the most gifted students.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: Which is NOT part of the American dream most people share?\n###"}

Spectrographs are used in a variety of fields, including astronomy, medicine, and law enforcement. They can sense the presence of explosives or drugs, and they can also help determine the age of a piece of artwork.\nNormally, the cost of a spectrograph can run as high as $100,000.Mary, however, built her device--which she crafted from lenses, a laser, aluminum   tubing, and a camera--for just $300.\"I wanted to build one that was lower-costing so it would be more available to anyone interested in spectrography,\" she said. \nSticking to a budget was only half the battle. Getting the machine to work was another challenge. \"I had to keep coming up with creative ways to adjust or change something,\" Mary admitted. \"It took three months to build and another three months before it actually functioned properly.\"\nMary competed with more than 1,700 other high school seniors in this year's science challenge.

{"prompt": "Popeye the Sailor first became a popular cartoon in the 1930s.The sailor in that cartoon ate lots of spinach to make him strong. People watched him, and they began to buy and eat a lot more spinach. Popeye helped sell 33 percent more spinach than before! Spinach became a necessary part of many people's diets. Even some children who hated the taste began to eat the vegetable.\nMany people thought that the iron in spinach made Popeye strong, but this is not true. Spinach does not have any more iron than any other green vegetable. People only thought spinach had a lot of iron because the people who studied the food made a mistake. In the 1890s, a group of people studied what was inside vegetables. This group said that spinach had ten times more iron than it did. The group wrote the number wrong, and everyone accepted it.\nToday, we know that the little iron there is in spinach cannot make a difference in how strong a person is. However, spinach does have something else which the body needs--folic acid.\nIt is interesting to point out that folic acid can help make a person strong.

Here are some examples of rudeness.\nSome people prefer to do almost everything over the internet. To them, dealing with an actual human is like an evolutionary step backward. It feels very slow because humans don, t work at 4G speeds. When you have dinner with friends, you will often notice someone paying more attention to his mobile phone.

If you have something awful to say, have the courage to face the person and say it, write a letter or email and sign it, or forget it. Upsetting people with unsigned messages is cruel and disgusting.\nWe shouldn't blame technology for our shortcomings. Technology is here to help us, but we should not allow it to take over our lives.

Whatever you're doing, stop and sit for one minute. While you're sitting there, completely _ yourself in the negative emotion.\nAllow that emotion to consume you. Allow yourself one minute to truly feel that emotion. Don't cheat yourself here. Take the entire minute--but only one minute--to do nothing else but feel that emotion.\nWhen the minute is over, ask yourself, \"Am I willing to keep holding on to this negative emotion as I go through the rest of the day?\"\nOnce you've allowed yourself to be totally immersed in the emotion and really feel it, you will be surprised to find that the emotion clears rather quickly.\nIf you feel you need to hold on to the emotion for a little longer, that is OK. Allow yourself another minute to feel the emotion.\nWhen you feel you've had enough of the emotion, ask yourself if you're willing to carry that negativity with you for the rest of the day. If not, take a deep breath. As you exhale, release all that negativity with your breath.\nThis exercise seems simple--almost too simple. But, it is very effective. By allowing that negative emotion the space to be truly felt, you are dealing with the emotion rather than stuffing it down and trying not to feel it. You are actually taking away the power of the emotion by giving it the space and attention it needs.

{"prompt": "Pulling luggage through the airport can be a pain, as any frequent traveler will tell you. A new suitcase called only \"Hop\" is looking to change all of that, though, using signals from your cell phone to go hands-free. \nAccording to Hop's official website, the suitcase uses threesensors  to identify the Bluetoothsignal from your phone and pick you out of a crowd. Once it's done that, a microprocessor not only figures out Hop's position as it relates to your phone, but controls the twocaterpillar tracks  in the bottom of the unit to get it moving. Hop follows behind the user at a constant distance, so you don't have to worry about it \"stepping\" on your heels, so to speak. If it loses the signal it's following, your phone will vibrate, letting you know that your poor suitcase is lost and alone in a sea of strange people.\nWe can see Hop in action in the video below, and we have to say that it looks like a great little device. There's just one problem: it looks as if you'll have to walk at a  ly slow pace to keep the suitcase from losing the signal. Since a walk through an airport is rarely a leisurely experience, that could potentially cause troubles. Also, don't expect TSA agents to just smile and wave as you walk through security with a remote-controlled suitcase tailing you.\nStill, the idea behind Hop is really cool, and we're willing to believe that there are some frequent flyers who would like to put down some money for it right this instant. However, this is just a model at the moment, so don't expect it to be available for sale anytime soon (if it ever is, for that matter).

But unlike those private schools, where fees can exceed PS28, 000 or PS45, 000 a year, Hockerill, in the Hertfordshire town, is a state comprehensive, which charges no tuition fees and is forbidden from selecting its students on the basis of academic ability. And while a third of Hockerill's 830 students are boarders, they are chosen on the basis of need rather than ability to pay.\nSo when the school's principal heard of government plans to raise university tuition fees in England to PS9, 000 a year, he decided to make use of the school's international focus. urging his students to apply to universities abroad and hiring a counselor  to help the students who want to apply to universities in countries whose fees are cheaper. \"If you can get into a university in France and pay about PS180 a year for an education at one of the best institutions in the world, why would you pay PS9, 000 a year in Britain?\" the principal asked.\nPupils at Hockerill are offered a choice of seven foreign languages: French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Japanese or Mandarin. History and geography classes are taught exclusively in French or German. But with English rapidly becoming the international language of education, even less linguistically flexible students soon find that going abroad can save them money while enhancing the quality of their education.\n\"Our students can get to Maastricht in Holland by train more quickly than they can get to Lees from London,\" the principal said. Just over the border from Germany and Belgium, Maastricht University offers a highly regarded undergraduate program taught in English. Tuition fees are about PS1, 430, a year. Germany and France offer even greater savings.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: What is Hockerill's suggestion to its students?\n###"}

She noted that females may seek out males that are more colorful and better singers, or look to \"step up in the world\" and move to areas that are safer and have more food. \"Females are looking for the highest quality male so that their children will be of high quality,\" she added.\nProfessor Stutchbury said shorter summers may drive females to leave their nests before their young are fully grown up so they can quickly find new mates  and lay more eggs, leaving the males to feed the hungry chicks on their own.\nMales can double their success in producing children by fertilizing neighboring females, but only \"mates\" care for the young, and some are none the wiser. \"  They can't tell when the egg comes out and whether it's theirs or not,\" She said. \"They have no way to know.\"\nDivorce is surprisingly common among birds, and most live with one partner for only a few months or years. Divorce rates range from 99 percent in the greater flamingo to zero in the wandering albatross .\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: What does the underline word \"dispels\" mean?\n###"}

Many times I've wanted to write for myself, for other women, for my parents, for my husband, and especially for my children. I would have liked to leave a legacy   of words explaining what it has meant to have twins. One reason that there is not a great deal written about being a mother of a new baby is that there is seldom a moment to think of anything else but the baby's needs.\nWith twins, I did not have a spare hand to write with.\nBefore my twins were born, my days were long and I had nothing to write about. After the twins' birth I did have something to write about, but I found myself facing not a pen and paper but milk bottles.\nSome nights, friends would visit. They would leave at 11 p.m., heading for bed, and for us the night was only just beginning. With twins, there is really no night. Each feeding lasts a long time. At 1:00 a.m., each of them would begin crying from hunger. At 4:00am, when I finally put them down, I felt exhausted.\nTwo years have passed since then and we've managed to live through it all.

{"prompt": "It would be hard to argue that there is anyone more powerful in Hollywood today than Steven Spielberg. Since his first major success Jaws in 1975, he has made one hit movie after another. These include the wildly popular series Indiana Jones, Jaws and ET.\nThose films are fun and lighthearted. But Steven Spielberg has also made serious films that were well received by critics   and movie audiences alike. The movie Saving Private Ryan is a good example. It is an American war movie in the traditional sense. But, the director's close attention to detail and historical facts also increased public interest in America's efforts during World War Two.\nThe film Schindler's List also takes place during World War Two. It tells the powerful story of a German businessman who worked to save Jews from Nazi Germany.\nSteven Spielberg was born in the city of Cincinnati, Ohio in 1946.His mother owned a restaurant and was also a musician. His father was an electrical engineer. Steven started making movies while he was growing up. He required his family and friends to pay twentyfive cents to see his films when they were completed. Steven Spielberg said this experience led him to produce the film Super Eight. It tells about a group of teenagers who join together to make a movie and uncover a mystery in the process.\nSteven Spielberg is one of the top directors in the film industry and also has many fans in China. When asked about the secret of his success, Steven Spielberg said that he owes much of his success and happiness to his wife and children. He met Cate Capshaw, who is an actress, when he was working on one of his films. After that it still took seven years before they finally got married. The couple has seven children in all.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: What's the similarity between Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List?\n###"}

{"prompt": "Maybe ten-year-old Elizabeth put it best when she said to her father, \"But, Dad, you can't be healthy if you're dead.\"\nDad, in a hurry to get home before dark so he could go for a run, had forgotten to wear his safety belt--a mistake 75% of the US population make every day. The big question is why.\nThere have been many myths about safety belts ever since their first appearance in cars some forty years ago. The following are three of the most common.\nMyth Number One: It's best to be \"thrown clear\" of a serious accident.\nTruth: Sorry, but any accident serious enough to \"throw you clear\" is also going to be serious enough to give you a very bad landing. And chances are that you'll have traveled through a wind shield  or door to do it. Studies show that chances of dying after a car accident are twenty-five times greater in cases where people are \"thrown clear\".\nMyth Number Two: Safety belts \"trap\" people in cars that are burning or sinking in water.\nTruth: Sorry again, but studies show that people knocked unconscious  due to not wearing safety belts have a greater chance of dying in these accidents. People wearing safety belts are usually protected to the point of having a clear head to free themselves from such dangerous situations, not to be trapped in them.\nMyth Number Three: Safety belts aren't needed at speeds of less than 30 miles per hour.\nTruth: When two cars traveling at 30 mph hit each other, an unbelted driver would meet the windshield with a force equal to diving headfirst into the ground from a height of 10 meters.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: Why did Elizabeth say to her father, \"But, Dad, you can't be healthy if you're dead\"?\n###"}
{"prompt": "Witchcraft was not made a capital offence in Britain until 1563 though it was disapproved by Pope Innocent VIII in 1484. From 1484 until around 1750, some 200,000 witches were burnt or hanged in Western Europe.\nMost supposed witches were usually old women, and always poor. Any who were unfortunate enough to be an old woman with broken teeth, sunken cheeks and sockets and a hairy lip were assumed to possess the \"Evil Eye\". It was more the case if they also had a cat. Many unfortunate women were taken away on this sort of evidence and hanged.\nWitch fever held East Anglia for 14 terrible months between 1645--1646. A man called Matthew Hopkins, an unsuccessful lawyer, contributed a lot! He became known as the \"Witchfinder General\". He had 68 people put to death in Bury St. Edmunds alone, and 19 hanged at Chelmsfor in a single day. After Chelmsford he set off for other countries. Much of Matthew Hopkins theories of telling a witch were based on Devil's Marks. He took a small mark to be a Devil's Mark and he used his \"needle\" to see if these marks were insensitive to pain. His \"needle\" was basically a trick so the unfortunate women never felt any pain.\nThere were other tests for witches. Mary Sutton of Bedford was put to the swimming test. With her thumbs tied to opposite big toes she was thrown into the river. If she floated she was guilty; if she sank, innocent. Poor Mary floated!\nThough many of the acts againsts witchcraft were put to an end in 1736, witch hunting still went on. In 1863, a suspected male witch was drowned in a pond in Headingham, Essex and 1945 the body of an elderly farm laborer was found near the village of Meon Hill in Warwickshire. His throat had been cut and his body was pinned to the earth. The murder remains unsolved; however, the man was said, locally, to be a male witch. It seems that belief in witchcraft has not entirely died out.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: Why did people throw Mary into the river?\n###"}

{"prompt": "The majority of physicists once believed that the universe's expansion was slowing down. In 1998, they were proven completely wrong. Though it flies in the face of scientific theory, the universe is expanding at an ever-increasing rate. \nOne possible explanation is that empty space has a thing called dark energy, which supposedly makes up about three quarters of the universe. Dark energy supposedly very sparsely  exists in such a way that it interacts with other objects only through attracting force. It has a strong negative pressure, which causes it to pull on its surroundings and as a result, pull apart the universe. This neatly explains the universe's expansion without completely changing our understanding of the universe. Scientists can merely claim that dark energy \"should\" exist. \nAccording to Einstein's theory of relativity, it is impossible to travel faster than at the speed of light. \nWith this in mind, physicists set out to do the impossible and succeeded. In 2000, scientists in Princeton, New Jersey sent a small pulse  of laser light through a vapor made up of gaseous cesium . The pulse traveled so quickly that it was already leaving the vapor-filled chamber as it was still entering, roughly 300 times faster than it would have in a vacuum . Thus, light moved faster than the speed of light. \nOther experiments have since managed to conquer light's supposed speed limit, though all claims have had fine print that keeps them from being especially groundbreaking . Those seeking to truly prove Einstein wrong must instead turn to objects like black holes, which could theoretically cause things to move at faster-than-light speeds. Black holes have been proven to be particularly uncooperative test subjects though, and for now this remains a guess.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: What did the scientists think before 1998?\n###"}
{"prompt": "Birds Can \"Read\" Human Gaze\nWe all know that people sometimes change their behavior when someone is looking their way. Now, a new study reported online on April 2nd in Current Biology shows that jackdaws--birds related to crows with eyes that appear similar to human eyes--can do the same.\n\"Jackdaws seem to recognize the eye's role in visual perception, or at the very least they are extremely sensitive to the way that human eyes are oriented ,\" said Auguste von Bayern, formerly of the University of Cambridge and now at the University of Oxford.\nWhen presented with a preferred food, hand-raised jackdaws took significantly longer to get the reward when a person was directing his eyes towards the food than when he was looking away, according to the research team led by Nathan Emery of the University of Cambridge and Queen Mary University of London. The birds hesitated only when the person was unfamiliar and thus potentially threatening.\nIn addition, the birds were able to interpret human communicative gestures, such as gaze alternation and pointing, to help them find hidden food, they found. The birds were unsuccessful in using unmoving cues, including eye gaze or head orientation.\nUnlike most birds, jackdaws' eyes have a dark pupil surrounded by a silvery white iris. The researchers said they believe jackdaws are probably sensitive to human eyes because, as in humans, eyes are an important means of communication for them. The hand-raised birds examined in the study may be even better than wild jackdaws at attending to human gaze and responding to the gestures of the people who have raised them.\nThe findings are particularly notable given that most other species investigated so far, including our closest  s the chimpanzee and \"man's best friend,\" the dog, are not particularly sensitive to eye orientation and eye gaze, von Bayern said. Rather, she continued, chimps and dogs seem to rely on other cues such as head or body orientation in determining the looking direction of others. The results suggest that birds may deserve more respect for their mental abilities. \n\"We may have understated the psychological world of birds,\" von Bayern said. \"Jackdaws, among many other birds, form pair ties for life and need to have much in common and work together with their partner, which requires an efficient way of communicating and sensitivity to their partner's viewpoint.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: What does the research finding suggest?\n###"}

{"prompt": "Becoming more popular in North America is Iceberg Water, which is harvested from icebergs off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada.\nArthur von Wiesenberger is one of the few water critics in North America.As a boy, he spent time in the larger cities of Italy, France and Switzerland, where bottled water is consumed daily.Even then, he kept a record of the brands he liked best.\"My dog could tell the difference between bottled and tap water,\" He says.\nBut is plain tap water all that bad? Not at all.In fact.New York's drinking water for more than a century was called the champagne of tap water and until recently considered among the best in the world in terms of both taste and purity.Similarly, a magazine in England found that tap water from the Thames River tasted better than several leading brands of bottled water that were 400 times more expensive.\nHowever, soft-drink companies view bottled water as the next battle-ground for market share, as bottlers and restaurateurs are longing for the profits from it.A restaurant's typical mark-up   on wine is 100 to 150 percent, while on bottled water it's often 300 to 500 percent.As a result, some restaurants are trying to sell more bottled water.Some of the more shameless tactics  include putting attractive bottles on the table for a visual sell, listing brands on the menu without prices, and pouring bottled water without even asking the diners whether they want it.\nRegardless of how it's sold, the popularity of bottled water taps into our desire for better health, our wish to appear educated, and even a longing for lost purity.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: Why are some restaurants willing to sell bottled water?\n###"}

I pressed all the buttons from 1to 14. I called for help very loudly. But nobody answered.\nThen suddenly the light went out, and I was alone in the dark. I started to cry and beat the walls of the lift. I cried and cried until I had no voice left. Then, I felt hopeless, and pressed all the buttons with my open hands. And all at the same time, there was a bell far away . It rang and rang. It was the fire alarm . I thought the whole building was on fire. I said to god quietly, \"Just get me out of here. I'll never be bad again.\"\nJust then, I realized the lift was moving very slowly . On the ground floor it stopped, and the doors opened. A man was standing there. \"How long have you been there? It is good that you pressed the alarm bell. But haven't you learned to read at your school?\" He pointed at a small piece of paper on the wall beside the lift.

{"prompt": "APRIL 5 marks the 100thanniversary of the sinking of the Titanic. In 1997, the movieTitanicwas a huge hit all around the world. Now, the 3-D version of the movie will come to Chinese theaters on April 10.\nAs anyone who has seen the movie knows, the Titanic struck an iceberg  and sank on its first _ in 1912, killing 1,517 people. A century after the accident, scientists have found something new to blame  for the sinking: the moon. Donald Olson, a Texas State University physicist, led a team of astronomers  to examine the moon's role, according to Reuters.\nNormally, icebergs stay in place and cannot move until they melt enough or a high tide  frees them. A single iceberg can become stuck many times on its journey southward. The process can take several years.\nAccording to Olson, a hundred years ago the moon made its closest approach to the Earth in more than 1,400 years. This caused the moon to have a much stronger pull on the Earth's oceans than usual, which created a super-high tide. The tide pushed icebergs from shallow waters off the coasts of Canada's provinces, Newfoundland and Labrador, into the Titanic's way.\n\"Of course, the final cause of the accident was that the ship struck an iceberg,\" Olson told Reuters. \"It went full speed into a region with icebergs, but thelunar connection  may explain how an unusually large number of icebergs got into the path of the Titanic.\"\nThe research team will publish their research in the April issue of Sky & Telescope magazine.\n,,.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: How many people lost their lives in this accident?\n###"}
{"prompt": "All over the world the need for more laptops and computers increases each year. Networks have been part of our life. Probably everyone with a portable device (} has once logged on to a public WiFi network without paying for it, while they are having a coffee, on a train, in a shopping mall or at a hotel. However, is this kind of public WiFi network safe?\nSome networks are better protected than others because encryption  methods are used. Therefore, they are safer than others. But a survey in 2015 showed that more than 950 million records were not protected, including addresses, emails, birth dales, phone numbers, passwords and so on. These open WiFi networks are really not safe, because it is very easy for hackers   to break into the operating system and get people's private information.\nMost smartphones and laptops, by themselves, search and connect to WiFi networks. They usually prefer a network with a connection that has been used before. Hackers' devices are able to record these searches and look like the trusted WiFi networks. When these smartphones and laptops log on to the networks which are not real, hackers can easily steal their private information.\nSo next time, when we want to use our laptops or our smartphones in public places which offer free WiFi networks,please think it twice or take safe measures before using them.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: Why do people like to go log on to a public WiFi network?\n###"}

{"prompt": "The population of the world is increasing rapidly. By 2020, there could be 7.5 billion people on the earth. Will there be enough food for all these people? Some scientists think fish farming might solve this problem. However, other scientists worry that fish farming could bring serious environmental problems.\nFish farming is not a new thing. There were fish farms in China 3,000 years ago. Today, about one third of the fish we eat comes from fish farms.\nMost fish farms raise plant-eating fish. Popular kinds of plant-eating fish are carp, tilapia, and catfish. However, many fish farms are starting to raise meat-eating fish. A popular type of meat-eating fish is salmon. However, it takes up to 5 tons of wild fish to produce just 1 ton of farm-raised salmon. So if this continued, many types of wild fish could become _ .\nCritics   of fish farming also say that farm-raised fish is unhealthy. They say there are dangerous chemicals   in the fish. They also say fish farming pollutes the water. Some people say that the ways of farming being used now won't produce enough fish anyway. Instead of building fish farms in lakes or near the coast, they say that the fish farms could be moved far out into the ocean. In the future, fish farms might be large cages that move to the ocean.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: How many reasons do the critics hold against the fish farming?\n###"}
{"prompt": "Life is full of surprises and you never know how things will turn out .Sir John Gurdon is a good example of this. As a boy, he was told he was hopeless at science and finished bottom of his class. Now, aged 79, the very same Gurdon shared the 2012 Nobe Prize in Medicine with Japanese stem cell  researcher Shinya Yamanaka.\nLike so many scientists, Gurdon shows us where the power of curiosity and perseverance  can lead.\nAt the age of 15 in 1948, Gurdon ranked last out of the 250 boys at his high school in biology and every other science subject. Gurdon's high school science teacher even said that his dream of becoming a scientist was\"quite ridiculous\".\nIn spite of his teacher s criticisms,Gurdon followed his curiosity and kept working hard. He went to the lab early and left later than anyone else. He experienced thousands of failures.\n\"My own belief is that we will, in the end, understand everything about how cells actually work,\" Gurdon said.\nIn 1962, Gurdon took a cell from an adult frog and moved its genetic information into an egg cell. The egg cell then grew into a clone  of the adult frog. This technique later helped to create Dolly the sheep in 1996, the first cloned mammal in the world.\nIn 2006,Gurdon's work was developed by Yamanaka to show that a sample of a person's skin can be used to create stem cells. Using this technique, doctors can repair a patient's heart after a heart attack.\nLuck favors the prepared mind Gurdon told the Nobel Prize Organization. \"Ninety percent of the time things don't work,but when they do,you have to seize the chance.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: Who won the 2012 Nobel Prize in Medicine?\n###"}

Some adults think it would probably never happen to them, so they don't teach their children what to do.

This doesn't mean children have to live in fear. When teaching them about disasters, keep the conversation positive by telling them there is a solution to the disaster. Keep the conversations short, allow for questions and answer honestly.\nPrepare: Always be prepared, that is the best advice for children. For example, when preparing for bad weather, get the tools you need, like candles, radios, food, water and medicine. Teach your child what is needed in certain disasters so that they know what is available for them, if ever needed.\nPlan: You should always have a plan for you and your child for any dangerous situation. Write out a simple list that they can read. The plan could start with \"listen to an adult's advice and/or call 119\".\nPractice: Once you have got the correct safety tools and worked out the right plan, practice every few months.

Kays of Scotland has been making curling stones since 1851, when William Kay and his sons Andrew and Thomas set up a workshop in Mauchline, Ayrshire, in southwest Scotland. Kays is still owned by the relatives of the founder, and today it is the only curling stone maker left in Scotland.\nUsed in a highly competitive sport, the curling stones are made to exact standards. First, stones are _ and then into round \"cheeses\". Finally, the cheeses are shaped and polished into curling stones in a series of steps.\nEach stone must weigh 44 pounds. Each must have a maximum diameter   of 36 inches. Polishing is done by hand on a wheel using water, diamond-talcum power, and felt. Finishing the stone's \"running edge\" is done entirely by hand with a special kind of paper and a digital measure and magnifying glass  . Lastly, a handle  is fitted into holes on the top of the stone. Stones are computer-matched into pairs. Sixteen stones----8 pairs----are needed for a game, and since curling game field usually have 6 lanes, each game field needs 96 matched stones!\nKays is a small company, employing less than ten skilled workers. Master craftsman and co-owner James Wyllie is skilled at all phases of curling stone making and is also an enthusiastic curler, as well as active member of Mauchline's Burns Club, which meets regularly to honor well-known Mauchline residents.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: How many curling stones are needed for two games happening at the same time?\n###"}
{"prompt": "How often do you change your hairstyle or ask for new clothes? Do you care much about fashion?\nA recent survey among high school students in China, Japan, South Korea and the US found that Asian teenagers cared more about their appearance   than teenagers in the US.\nThe survey was made in 156 high schools in the four countries. South Koreans cared most about their appearance. They were followed by the Chinese and Japanese, while US students showed the least interest in fashion.\n\"The different results show the differences of cultural backgrounds  ,\"said Sun Yunxiao from the China Youth and Children Research Centre.\nHe explained that in the US there are many different standards   of beauty, so teens are more likely to be confident about their appearance. About 85% of American teens are happy with themselves. Besides, most US students agree that people should follow their own interests rather than those of others.\n\"According to the survey, Chinese students are happy and disciplined  .

When a customer walks into a \"fitting\" room, they'll stand in front of a big screen that looks like a mirror. A camera in the mirror, using Microsoft Kinect, monitors a customer's movement and projects a 3-D image of the clothes onto you while you stand before a screen.\nThe room also uses augmented reality technology. \"Augmented reality allows the customers to choose an item of clothing without having to try it on physically,\" the company told the Daily Mail. A customer can spin around to see all angles  of the clothes, and can control the program by pushing virtual buttons.\nAR Door is not the only company to be developing technology to help people with the way they look. Japanese company Shiseido recently presented its Magic Mirror, a virtual make-up mirror that allows people to get a full makeover in seconds.\nHowever, the technology is not perfect. The clothes still seem to hang on the surface of the body, rather than look like the customer is actually wearing them. And people shopping for clothes are probably still better off actually trying them on.\nIn the end, you won't know how something really looks and feels.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: In the virtual fitting room, what is on the screen?\n###"}

But if you are lucky, you can make the round  trip in 45 minute.\nLast Monday I stood at the bus stop for fifteen minutes, waiting for a bus. By the time I saw one come around the corner, there was not enough time left to make the trip---- so I had to go back to the office. The same thing happened on Wednesday. On Thursday my luck changed, I got on a bus right away and arrived at the cinema in twenty minutes. But when I got there, I found a long line of people at the box office. I heard one man say he had been waiting in line for fifty-five minutes. I found that I would not have enough time to wait in line, I caught the next bus and went back across the town.\nBy Friday I understood my only hope was to make the trip by car.it was not cheap,but I felt it would be worth ot to see the film. The trip by car only took 10 minutes, but it felt like one hour to me. When I reached the cinema, I was _ to see that nobody was waiting in line. But quickly found out that it was because they had already sold all the tickets.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: What's the title of the story?\n###"}

{"prompt": "How long are you willing to wait for a webpage to open before you start to lose your patience? Half a minute? A few seconds? Google engineers have discovered that even 400 milliseconds--as short as the blink of an eye--is too long for most Internet users.\nA millisecond is one thousandth of a second. People hardly notice such a small time difference, but it does cause them to stop searching, reported The New York Times. \"Without question, nobody likes to wait,\" said Arvind Jain, a Google engineer. \"Every millisecond matters.\"\nNowadays, millions of smart-phones and computers are continually gathering and sending out information. With so many people downloading maps, sports videos, news and restaurant recommendations, you can get digital \"traffic jams\". Meanwhile, users are expecting faster and faster service.\nGoogle found that if one website is 250 milliseconds slower than another website, then people will visit it less often. This is why technology companies are now competing to be the fastest. Google said people do expect different things from different websites because they realize not all loading times are the same. For example, a person will be more patient waiting for a video to load than for a search result.\nEven so, four out of five online users will click away if a video takes too long to load. This makes it difficult for video websites to choose between the quality of pictures and fast loading times.\nTrying to get a higher speed has always been part of the history of the Internet. In the 1990s, when the World Wide Web first started to become popular, it was very crowded and slow; people called it the \"World Wide Wait\". But engineers managed to fight the problem with new inventions. They laid a lot of fiber optic cables  for sending in high speed; they improved software so it would work more smoothly; they placed computer servers all around the world to be nearer to users; all this increased speed.\nNowadays we can enjoy much faster Internet. Famous search engines such as Google and Microsoft's Bing usually find search results in less than a second. _ .\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: The report from The New York Times suggests that\n###"}

{"prompt": "Rock climbing  did not become a sport until late in the 1900s. But now it has become a popular outdoor activity. While rock climbing may still be necessary for mountain climbing, most people just climb low mountains for fun.\nIf you have ever done rock climbing, you will know that it is not a very easy sport. Indoor and outdoor rock climbing both need practice. What most people don' t know is that rock climbing is one of the sports that depend on your body and mind .\nTo climb successfully, one must use wonderful skills. One of the important rules is to always have three parts of your body on the rock face. Another important rule is that your arms only hold you close to the rock face while your legs are pushing you up, the closer you are to the rock face, the easier it is to climb.\nRock climbing is a wonderful sport. Once you start to learn how to climb, you'll find more fun. People who like games such as chess playing or problem-solving may love rock climbing, because they are nearly the same in the way of thinking.

{"prompt": "In today's world, sleep experts say that for a better night's rest, Americans should turn off their smartphones or iPad before sleeping. Such electronic products make the brain more active, and then influence their sleep. But according to a latest survey, more than 90% of Americans regularly use a computer or some other kinds of electronic products in the hour before bed.\nResearchers are finding that man-made light from some electronic products at night may reduce the brain chemicals  that help sleep. The researchers showed that sitting in the light from computer tablets clearly lowered levels of the chemical which manages our body clocks and plays a role in the sleep cycle.\nIn the study, the researchers let volunteers read, play games and watch movies on a tablet for different time while measuring  how much light their eyes received. They found that two hours of sitting before a bright tablet screen at night reduced the sleep chemical levels by about 22%.\nStudies of students using computers at night have got the similar results. And researchers say _ may not only cause sleeplessness, but also raise the risk of obesity , diabetes  and other diseases.\nTo be on the safe side, the researchers advise us to use computers less before bed, or at the very least turning down your screen as much as possible.\n.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: How may electronic products influence people's sleep?\n###"}

{"prompt": "Can you remember a world before the Internet? If you answer is \"no,\" then you are probably a millennial. Millennials are the new generation of young Americans. They were born between 1982 and 1992. There are 33 million of them, and they are just starting to enter the workforce . Many experts believe that millennials are different from young Americans of past generations. They also believe that millenials will change the workforce in important ways.\nHow are millennials different? They are the first generation born in the computer age. The internet has always been a part of their lives. They spend about 16 hours a week on the Internet, and this doesn't include e-mail. And they spend 72 hours a week using other electronic media , including mobile phones and video games. They are \"nation speakers\" of the language of the computer age. People who were born earlier will never be native speakers of that language. Why not? They did not grow up \"speaking\" it.\nHow will millennials change the workforce? To answer that question, it is important to understand how millennials use the Internet. They use the Internet to communicate. They visit website such as FaceBook and MySpace every day. They share ideas, music, information, games, and friendships with people all over the world. When they start working, they will want to share their work and ideas with others.\nIt is also important to understand the way millennials grew up. Thair parents and teachers gave them a lot of attention. They taught them that their opinions were valuable . As a result, amny millennials are very cinfident. At work, they will expect their co-workers and bosses to listen to their opinions.\nMillennials also grew up with a lot of structure in their lives. Many of them went to school from the age of two or three and played on sports teams. At work, they will expect the rules to be clear. They will also expect a strong but fair boss, like a coach on a sports team. They will follow the person in charge   if he or she is fair. But they will not follow an unfair boss. They will also expect their work to be fun and creative, similar to their experience on a sports team.\nThese are a few of the changes that experts believe millennials will bring to the American workforce. But the world is changing very fast. There will probably be more changes that are difficult to imagine today.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: Why do the millennials experct to share their work and ideas with others?\n###"}

{"prompt": "You change the channels for the fourth time and realize that once again there's nothing on television that gets your attention. Not a problem! Throw on some running shoes and comfortable clothes and go for a run.\nOne of the coolest things about the sport of running is that you don't need expensive equipment . All you need is a good pair of running shoes and a safe environment. But just because you don't need much equipment don't be fooled into thinking the sport of running is easy. No one wakes up and decides to run a marathon without training.\nRunning makes your heart, lungs, and muscles stronger. It makes you know more about your body. Running also gives you energy by increasing your oxygen  intake, so you don't get sick easily. It can even help you keep your mind on school work because exercise helps you to think more clearly.\nHow do you take part in the sport if you don't know much about it? Most schools offer cross-country and track programs, but there are also running clubs open to all ages. A simple Internet search can help you find some in your area. The programs show you how running can offer competition or just be for fun. They also teach runners to set realistic goals and take care of their bodies.\nRunners have great respect for each other because they know how difficult the sport can be. If you go to a race, you'll see people cheering for all the runners, from the first place finisher to the last place finisher. Running isn't always about how fast you are or how far you're going. It's about getting out there and doing it. Taking part is more important than competition, and effort is recognized over gift.\nIf you're looking for more than just a sport, running may be the perfect choice for you.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: What is the most important for runners in a race?\n###"}

Food cooks quickly in parabolic cookers. However, these cookers are hard to make. They must be moved again and again to follow the sun. Parabolic cookers can also cause burns and eye injuries if they are not used correctly.\nYou can make sun-cookers from boxes or heavy paper. They will not catch fire. Paper burns at 232degC. A sun-cooker never gets hotter than that. Sun-cookers cook food at low temperatures over long periods of time. This allows people to cook food and do other things at the same time.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: Which kind of sun-cooker costs very little?\n###"}

He is considered as one of the worst tyrants  who brought the Sui Dynasty to an end in Chinese history. But in fact, he started the construction of the Grand Canal  to connect the North and the South, making Yangzhou a transportation hub  city.\nAs we know, Emperor Yang loved Yangzhou very much. Throughout his life, he paid three visits to Yangzhou. On his first tour to Yangzhou, he stayed here for eight months. And the second time, he enjoyed an extravagant lifestyle in Yangzhou. He watched the song and dance shows all day and stayed in Yangzhou for nearly a year. The third time, he enjoyed himself drinking wine without planning to go back to the capital. It lasted for almost one and a half years. In the year AD 618, Emperor Yang was killed by his followers in one of his palaces in Yangzhou, and the Sui Dynasty ended.\nEveryone complains that the Sui Dynasty ended because of the Grand Canal. However, it is still an important way for people to travel. In the year AD 605, Emperor Yang ordered the canal to be dug. Digging such a long canal proved to be very difficult. 3.6 million people worked on it and in less than a year many of them lost their lives. When the construction was completed, the journey from the north to the south became more direct. It is the longest canal in the world. It runs from Beijing to Hangzhou, covering a distance of nearly 1,800 kilometres and joining five rivers including the Yellow River and the Yangtze River. Even today, the Grand Canal still plays an important role in travel.

Our English teacher often teaches us English songs, the songs sound nice. I often think how interesting English is!\nSecond, I think English is a foreign language. I should learn it well in the following ways: Listen to the teacher carefully, speak bravely, read aloud and have a good vocabulary . Then practice again and again, never be tired. And I also have a good habit: Asking whenever I have a question, I must make it clear by asking our English teacher. How happy I am when I understand!\nBesides this, I often read English stories, jokes and easy novels. From these I know English is not only interesting, but also useful. They help me understand a lot of things. So to do more reading is an important way to learn English well.\nAnd I also do some exercises from our class magazines, and I often write English diaries. English has become a close friend of mine.\nNow I have learned English for more than two years. I always keep the first position in our school. From these words, I hope every student can learn English well.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: Why do some students often \"have a headache\"?\n###"}

The Lab is a place where students can do all kinds of experiments and test their ideas. Kids can work in groups in the same projects in The Camp Fire. The Show Off is where kids can show their inventions. And if the kids need a rest, they can visit The Watering Hole, which has all kinds of fun activities.\nSounds great?

{"prompt": "7 January, 2014\nA new report says more and more international students are attending colleges and universities in the United States. It also notes a large increase in the number of international students from China.\nThese findings are from the latest Open Doors Report. The report documents the record number of international students in the United States during 2012, 2013 school year. It says more than seven hundred sixty-four thousand four-hundred such students were attending American colleges and universities during the last two years. That represents an increase of almost six percent than one year earlier. On the other hand, the number of Americans studying overseas  increased by one percent, which reached nineteen thousand this year.\nThe report says one hundred ninety-four thousand students at American colleges and universities were from China .That is an increase of more than twenty-three percent over the year before. Peggy Blumenthal, an expert of international education, described the effect of the increase in Chinesestudents.\n\"Now they have been coming for some time. But this year was the highest level ever.\" She says many Chinese families are able to pay for the highest-quality education for their children. The children mainly choose to study in America.\n\"We know many of them have enough income to be able to afford to send them anywhere in the world if they want to go. And for the most part, looking around the world, Chinese students still prefer to come to the United States as their choice.\"\nChinese students are not the only ones who want to attend American colleges and universities. After China, India sends the second largest number of students to the United States for higher education. India has about one hundred thousand students in American schools. South Korea is third with about seventy-two thousand students.\nWhy do so many foreign students study in the United States? Peggy Blumenthal provides one reason.\n\"The advantage America has is that we have a huge system  and a very perfect system. So there are over four thousand universities and colleges in the United States. Among them are some top ones in the world, and what that tells us is there is still a lot of room to host international students.\nForeign students represent less than four percent of the total student population in American higher education.

{"prompt": "Some inventions are so useful, but seem so simple, that we wonder why no one thought of them long ago. Post-it Notes, the pieces of paper that you can fasten almost anywhere and then remove without leaving any sign that they were there, are an example of such an invention.\nPost-it Notes were invented about twenty years ago by Art Fry, a scientist at 3M Corporation. The idea for the product came from a frustrating experience he often had while singing in his church choir. Fry used pieces of paper as bookmarks to mark the places in his book of songs, but these bookmarks were always falling out. He knew he needed a bookmark that would stay where he put it, but that he could remove without damaging the pages.\nAround that time, Fry heard about a new adhesive   that a workmate, Dr. Spence Silver, had created. This adhesive was special because it was sticky, but not too sticky. It was strong enough to hold papers together, but weak enough to not tear the paper when it was removed. Fry saw that the new adhesive could help solve his bookmark problem. One morning, Fry put some of the adhesive on the edge of a piece of paper. Just as he hoped, it made a perfect bookmark.\nA short time later, Fry realized that his new invention had even more uses than being a great bookmark. He came to this realization when he wrote a note on one of his new \"bookmarks\" and attached it to a report he was going to give to a workmate. Soon, co-workers were asking Fry for more samples of his invention so that they could use the new type of notes themselves.\nFry and some other people at 3M believed so much in the new product that they persuaded the company to give away thousands of the \"sticky pieces of paper\" for trial use . When some salespeople at 3M went to offices and showed workers just how helpful the new type of notes could be, they immediately received many orders. As more and more people discovered how useful Post-it Notes could be, the product _ .\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: In what way did Dr. Spence help Art Fry?\n###"}

{"prompt": "One day a poor farmer was taking a bag of rice to town. Suddenly the bag fell from his horse on the road.

{"prompt": "College is an exciting time to learn and to make friends that will last a lifetime. Many students do not like to worry about money, and they would rather not think about it. But, it doesn't matter whether a student's parents pay for everything, or whether the students work part-time to help pay for his or her education. All students can get into money trouble if they're not careful.\nThe cost of a college education can be quite expensive. In English-speaking countries, the average cost per student per year is well over US$10,000. Students must also pay for books, paper, pens, and etc. These can cost $500 to $1,000 per year. Students who live in university housing pay thousand more per year for room and board . Add money for clothes, travel, and other personal expenses, and the cost of one year at a university can be $20, 000 to $30,000 or more.\nStudents need to spend their money carefully. At most universities, advisors can give students advice on how to budget  their money. They suggest this: at the start of a school term, write down your income; for example, money you will get from your family or a part-time job. Then, list all of your expenses. Put your expenses into two groups: those that change (food, phone, books, travel), and those that will stay the same (tuition, room and board). Add together all of your expenses. Are they more than your income? Do you have enough money, or do you need more?\nLearning not to spend more money than you have is not always easy. But for many, it is easier than borrowing money from family or friends.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Question: How much will a college student spend in total every year?\n###"}

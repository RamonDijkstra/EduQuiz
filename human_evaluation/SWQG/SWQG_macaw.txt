Alice's mother died when she was five. Although her brothers and sisters were loving and caring, their love couldn't take the place of a mother's. In 1925 Alice became my mother and told me that her family couldn't even afford her a doll.
One afternoon in December 1982, when I was getting ready for Christmas, I suddenly decided to buy two dolls, one for my five-year-old daughter, Katie, and one for my old mother.
Things went smoothly when a friend told me that his dad, who played Santa Claus in my area, would be willing to make a visit on Christmas morning to our home with the gifts! Knowing that my parents would also come to my house, I began to get ready for the most memorable day of my mother's life.
Christmas Day arrived and so did Santa Claus at the planned time. Katie was very excited and happy all the time to welcome the Santa. My mother was enjoying watching Katie welcoming this special guest. As Santa turned to leave he looked again into his bag and took out one more gift. As he asked who Alice was, my mother, without thinking of her name being called, said that she in fact was Alice. Santa handed her the gift with a message card that read:
For Alice:
I was cleaning out my sleigh   before my trip this year and came across this package that should be sent on December 25, 1925. The gift inside has aged, but I felt that you might still wish to have it. Many apologies for the lateness of the gift.
Love,
Santa Claus
My mother was very excited and deeply moved to tears. She couldn't speak but only held tightly in her arms the doll she had waited fifty-seven years to receive as tears of joy flew down her face. That doll made my mother the happiest "child".

Question: Santa Claus gave Katie a doll for Christmas. What did Santa say about the doll?
Answer: it was old

British newspapers are among the oldest and most famous in the world. But recently big changes have seen these traditional publications try to fit the modern world. After 221 years, The Times has changed its size to become much smaller. In fact, the paper has cut its size in half from a broadsheet to tabloid . 
In prefix = st1 /Britainthe newspaper market is divided between the larger broadsheets and the smaller tabloids. These terms refer to the size of the papers' pages but there is also a clear difference in content. Broadsheets such as The Times, the Guardian and Daily Telegraph are serious papers. They cover a broad range of political, economic and international issues. Their stories are also reasonably long and use quite formal language.
Tabloids have far more stories about less serious issues such as celebrities' love lives. Their stories are shorter and use more simple language. Tabloids often have bigger pictures. Britain's best-selling newspaper, the Sun, is a tabloid and has a naked girl on Page Three every day.
By changing to the size of a tabloid, The Times is following in the footsteps of a less famous broadsheet paper the Independent . It changed to tabloid last year and saw its sales increase greatly. Although both papers have switched to the smaller size the content of the papers has remained the same. They are both still serious papers. 
The two papers claim that people find the smaller size easier to handle when they travel to work on the bus or the train in the morning. Instead of calling the new style of their paper tabloid, the paper says its new size is "compact" .

Generated quiz:
Question: A newspaper is a kind of media. Which type of media is the Times?
Answer: newspaper
MC option A) book 
MC option B) newspaper 
MC option C) magazine

Dear Ms Morris,
We have come to know of an unfortunate incident you had with our customer service department and we would like to deeply apologize for the inconvenience caused to you by the customer service manager's behavior. We have noted down your complaint (number 797329SA) and would like to let you know that strict action will be taken against the employee.

To express our appreciation, please accept the offer of free servicing of all products of our company that you own for up to three years. We will also make sure that the faulty  air conditioner is replaced by us at no extra cost so that you do not face any further problem.

The Streisand Effect
When Barbra Streisand discovered in 2003 that a photograph of her California beach house was among 12,000 photos on the Internet as part of a collection by a photographer Kenneth Adelman, she did what any famous person would do: hit him with a $50 million lawsuit  . But in trying to hold back the images, she caused a different result. Her legal actions led to almost half a million people visiting the website, viewing and copying the photos within a month.
Ever since then, the effect of letting public know something you are trying to keep secret has been called the "Streisand effect". The problem for anyone trying to cover up information is that the Internet is the world's biggest and most useful copying machine. Put a document   on to a connected machine and it will spread. So when you want to be famous, you can't, but if you find yourself receiving too much attention and want to remove yourself, you cannot.  
There are many examples of the Streisand effect. Nine-year-old Martha Payne created a simple blog, posting the meals her school served. She took a photo of what was hardly a satisfying meal by anyone's standards. With the photo, she added a comment, "Now Dad understands why I am hungry when I get home." The thing did not go too far, until the local authority   banned   little Martha from doing that again. Martha posted a final post called "Goodbye", explaining everything. Once the media found this out, things went from bad to worse for the authority. Now the blog has more than 9.5 million page views. Martha has even expanded her blog by including pictures of school meals taken by other kids from all over the world, like Germany and Japan.
We can find similar examples throughout history. Man has experienced the Streisand effect ever since the birth of mass communication. Why does it exist? Every time you are told not to see what's in the secret shiny box wrapped in gift paper, you're going to do everything in your power to do exactly that! Just realizing that knowing something about someone is harmful to their status, we will want to know that piece of information. This is exactly the human nature. This is what lawyers and authorities should be familiar with. Unfortunately, a few of them fail to understand it.

Five-year-old Jocelyn Rojas spent all day playing happily with her friends outside her grandmother's apartment building. Her mom, Jaimee, kept her eye on the little girl from a window. At about 4 p.m., Jocelyn walked around the corner of the building to get her bicycle. However, half an hour later, she disappeared. Jaimee called 911.
A short time later, police officers and firefighters crowded inthe area, blocking streets and searching the neighborhood. Officers handed out photos of the girl wearing thick-framed glasses.
Temar Boggs, 15, a school athlete in track, was with some friends moving a couch into the apartment of his elderly neighbor when one officer approached him and asked if he'd seen Jocelyn. Unfortunately, none of them had seen her. A little bit later, Temar and his friends went to check out the situation. By 6:30 p.m., Jocelyn had been missing for more than two hours, and the search team was worried that the sun would set before she was found.
Just at that moment, Temar felt an intense emotion that he was going to find her. He and his friend Chris Garcia, 13, rode alongside, simply keeping a sharp eye out as they circled around. Then Temar spotted a car circling around, as if the driver were unfamiliar with the neighborhood. Temar cycled close and made eye contact with the man behind the wheel, an older guy wearing a red-and-white striped shirt, and saw a tiny blond girl in the passenger seat. Temar instantly realized it must be the missing girl.
The boys cycled after the car, but the driver kept moving, winding his way through the neighborhood.
Finally, the driver had to park the car ahead of them and pushed open the passenger-side door. A girl slipped out of the car. It was Jocelyn. Temar got off his bike, and carried her to the police. The kidnapper sped away.
A police report later identified the man as a 63-ycar-old sex offender. He is still _ .
Neil Harkins, chief of the Manheim Police Department, says "The boys' heroics are 'something we don't normally hear about.' It is a very brave thing for young boys to do that." But when asked, Temar, now a tenth-grade student at Lucy Laney High School, says "I didn't do it for attention. I just wanted to help."

"Thanks for coming," Everett said, shaking hands with Mr. Hanson, the town councilor  . 
              "I'm curious about the ideas in your letter." Mr. Hanson nodded toward the parking lot near where they stood. "Please tell me more." 
              Everett took a deep breath. "Ever since the school closed two years ago, this area has become worse. But if we clean up the litter and repair the fence, it will be a great place for a skateboard park." Mr. Hanson scanned the broken concrete, nodding. "The old school is being adapted to a community arts centre. This area could become a vital part of the neighbourhood again." 
              "Here's a picture of a skateboard park in another town. Look how busy it is." Everett was relieved that the community representative seemed receptive to the idea. Mr. Hanson studied the photograph, and then asked, "If town council provides the money, how will you and your friends contribute?" Everett felt optimistic now. "We'll help design and build the ramps . More experienced boarders could give lessons to raise money!" Everett's voice was enthusiastic. 
              However, Mr. Hanson said, "We'll still need parking spaces, and the neighbours will not like late-night noise. They might worry about the crime of deliberately damaging public property and...."
              "The skateboard park would use only the back corner, which isn't near any houses. Since young people already hang out here, why not give them something fun and physically active to do in their free time?"              The lines over Mr. Hanson's forehead unwrinkled  , and Everett's hopes rose again. "If everyone works together," Everett thought, "maybe this idea will become reality."

Science Fiction
The science fiction type of entertainment is considered by most to be fathered by Jules Verne (A Journey to the Center of the Earth and Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea) and H. G. Wells (The Time Machine and The War of the Worlds). Sci-Fi, as it is commonly shortened, is a fictional story in which science and technology have a significant influence on the characters and plot. Many such works are guesswork about what the future holds and how scientific findings and technological advances will shape humankind.
Writing in the late 1800s, Jules Verne was remarkably successful in his 10 guesses about future technologies of air conditioning, automobiles, the Internet, television, and underwater, air, and space travel. Unbelievably, of all places from which to choose, Jules Verne guessed Tampa, Florida, USA as the launching site of the first project to the Moon, which was only 200 kilometers away from the actual 1969 location at Cape Canaveral, Florida.
One of the best-known science fiction books is Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell. Published in 1949, it was not meant as a prediction, but as a warning: Orwell was describing what he saw as the outcome of the ideas, trends, and emerging technologies of his time. Many invented terms from this novel have become common in everyday use, such as "big brother" and "doublethink". Even the author's name has been made into an adjective--Orwellian--and has become a warning descriptor for situations where privacy is lost and the individual becomes sacrifice under a totalitarian  government. Nineteen Eighty-Four was translated into sixty-five languages within five years of its publication, setting a record that still stands.
What helps bring science fiction into being is usually a new discovery or innovation. The author creates an analysis of the potential influence and consequences and then wraps it in a pleasant story. For example, the beginning of space exploration was followed a few years later by the Star Trek television program and movie series. Advances in genetics  cause fantasies of the end of disease, horrors of eugenics , and thrillers where creatures disappearing long ago are brought back to life. The science fiction author's self-determined role is that of field glasses for humanity--searching the world of future possibilities upon the road which we are traveling.

The challenge to drink to the limits of one's endurance has become a celebrated part of college life. In one of the most extensive reports on college drinking thus far, a 1997 Harvard School of Public Health study found that 43 percent of college students admitted binge drinking in the preceding two weeks (Defined as four drinks in a sitting for a woman and five of a man, a drinking binge is when one drinks enough to risk health and well - being )
Experts estimate that excessive drinking is involved in thousands of student deaths a year. And the Harvard researchers found that there has been a dramatic change in why students drink. 39 percent drank "to get drunk" in 1993, but 52 percent had the same objective in 1997.
"What has changed is the across - the - board acceptability of intoxication  ," says Felix Savino at UW - Madison. Many college students today see not just drinking but being drunk as their primary way of socializing.
The reasons for the shift are complex and not fully understood. But researchers guess that it may have something to do with today's instant - satisfaction life - style--and young people tend to take into the extreme.
While binge drinking isn't always deadly, it does have other, wide - ranging effects. Academics is one area where it takes a heavy  _ (something paid, lost or suffered). Perhaps because alcohol increases aggression and affects judgement, it is also related to 25 percent of violent crimes and roughly 60 percent of vandalism on campus. Facing the many potential dangers, college campuses are searching for ways to reduce binge drinking.

Generated quiz:
Question: Students who drink too much alcohol are more likely to commit crimes such as theft and vandalism. What is the most likely reason for this?

MC option A) the alcohol was poured down a drain

Most Americans receive at least two or three credit card applications in the mail every month.Why have credit cards become so popular? For a merchant, the answer is obvious.By putting charge slips  in a bank, the merchant can change credit card sales into cash.In return for processing the merchant's credit card transactions , the bank charges a fee that ranges between 1.5 and 5 percent.
         The easiest way to establish credit is to open checking and savings accounts at your local bank.Then apply for a gasoline or store credit card.These cards are fairly easy to get because retailers  want you to buy their goods and services.The third step, and the most dangerous one, is obtaining a major credit card like Visa, MasterCard, or American Express.
       It is important to choose a credit card carefully because terms and conditions vary widely.Annual fees range from $15 to $75 a year, but some credit card companies charge no annual fee at all.If you will be one of the growing number of people who don't pay off their credit card debts in full each month, look for the card with the lowest interest rate.Interest rates generally range from 12 to 18 percent, though it is possible to find cards with lower rates.
       A credit card can be your friend because it can get you through unexpected emergencies.And if there is a problem with the products or service you purchase with your credit card, you have an opportunity to hold back payment by asking the credit card company to "charge back" to the retailer until the argument is settled.Monthly credit card statements can also help you keep your records in order.Finally, if you make payments on time, the card helps you to establish a good credit history.
       A credit card can be your enemy because it is an invitation to purchase items you really do not need.The credit card companies' continuous offers of minimum payments, cash advances, and even months without payments may seem like a way to skate through a money crisis.In reality, your finance charges and fees only increase, and you go deeper into debt.
       If you do find yourself in trouble, do not ignore the bills.Contact your creditors to explain your problem and express your desire to pay down your card balance.If that fails, a nonprofit organization like Consumer Credit Counseling Service can assist you in getting back on your financial feet.

Generated quiz:
Question: A student uses a credit card to pay for school supplies. The student's mother objects to the use of the credit card because it is used for personal expenses. The student's mother contacts the credit card company to have the charges reversed. What is the purpose of this action?
Answer: to collect money owed
MC option A) to collect money owed 
MC option B) to establish good credit history 
MC option C) to get the goods or services you need 
MC option D) to make a profit

There is an English saying that goes, "he who laughs last, laughs the hardest." High School Musical star and teen heartthrob  Zac Efron is laughing a lot these days.
  As a young boy, Efron was picked on in school because he was always the smallest in his class and teased because he had a big space between his teeth. In the sixth grade, Efron's basketball team made it to the league championships. In double overtime  , with three seconds left, he rebounded the ball and passed it to the wrong team! They scored and his team lost the game.
  But history, as they say, is a thing of the past. Now at 21, Efron is one of People magazine's 100 Most Beautiful People, graces the cover of Entertainment Weekly, Hollywood's most influential magazine, and is traveling the world promoting the third High School Musical film. Director Adam Shankman described Efron as "arguably the biggest teen star in America right now." Simply google "Zac Efron" and you get more than 14 million responses. Yes, it seems Efron has a lot to smile about these days.
  Efron was born and raised in California. He took school seriously. According to Efron, "he would flip out if he got a B and not an A in school, and that he was a class clown." It was his father who encouraged him to act. He took part in school performances and with a local theater group. He also took singing lessons. He graduated from high school in 2006 and was admitted to the University of Southern California to study film. But he deferred --why study movies when you can star in them.
  Now he has signed on to star in the romantic comedy Seventeen Again and to play in the remake of the hugely popular movie, Footloose. Efron is also earning more than $3 million for his role in High School Musical 3. Not bad for a 21-year-old. But Efron still remembers those bullies.
   "You always have to remember that bullies want to bring you down because you have something that they admire," Efron said. "Also, when you get made fun of, when people point out your weaknesses, it's an opportunity for you to rise above."

Teachers and textbooks  _ -- your future could be under threat from a quickly developing and very smart technology.
     University of California researchers led by Jacob White hill recently programmed teaching robots to react to facial expression. Whitehill's achievement marked a major step forward in the way people could one day learn by establishing facial expression recognition in robot teachers.
     The teaching robots or, Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) are computer systems that provide personalized instruction and feedback to students without human intervention. The facial expression recognition allows a computer to react according to expressions a user makes.
     He said that the system was an important development in improving learning systems.
"Classical ITS typically have a somewhat rigid architecture of 'first I ask a questions then I wait for a responses then I talk some more; then I wait for another response.' Facial expression recognition, I believe, will allow the feedback from student to teacher to happen while the robot teacher is talking," Whitehill said.
     Experts agree the latest developments in ITS open new possibilities for how people could learn. University of Memphis researcher, Dr Andrew Olney, who recently received a US$ I. 3 million grant to develop an ITS, said the key to future learning will be enabling interactive , one-on-one instruction.
     "The technology can benefit these more advanced learning scenarios ," he said.
     Although robot teachers of varying abilities have existed for more than 30 years, ITS developments such as Whitehill's and Olney's are pushing beliefs that robots could soon be as effective as-- if not more effective than human teachers.
     "The ITS which have been developed are already better teachers than people who have no experience," Olney said.
     So, what is the future for today's teachers, classrooms, and textbooks?

The Haitian tsunami gave scientists a chance to find out how well vital and potentially life-saving warning systems were working.
Noaa's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory has developed a warning system that picks up signals of tsunamis directly from the sea-floor.
It is called Dart-the Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis. If seismometers  detect an earthquake, the Dart buoys  will determine what is happening to sea levels, and whether a big wave might be on the way. This information is then sent via satellite to a central location which can organize an alarm. Within 50 minutes of the Haiti earthquake, this system was able to issue an alarm to other countries in the Caribbean to say that a small tsunami had been caused to start, and that was unlikely to affect them.
Dr Bernard said, "The first 30 minutes following the earthquake, we have to rely on education." The critical aspects of this are: do you feel the earthquake; do you see the ocean draw down; and do you hear that loud roar? If so, you should run for higher ground.
"But after the first few minutes, it's crucial that we have the technology--the measurements to avoid unnecessary evacuation and tell people when it is safe to return." Right now, there are 50 of these Dart buoys all over the globe--four of which are in the Caribbean.
Dr Bernard says that, with 75 to 100 buoys worldwide, this system could provide global tsunami warnings within one hour.
"That's for everywhere we know that tsunamis have happened. If we wanted to go to half an hour detection, we could probably double or multiply by four times that number," he said.
"In some countries, including Haiti, there may not be enough resources to support a specific tsunami warning centre for something that happens so infrequently."
He said that this system was relatively inexpensive to fix and operate.
"To get it down to an hour for everywhere affected would cost $50m initial investment and then 10% of that to maintain it," he said.
"That's not a terribly expensive system considering the potential savings of lives."

Directions: Read the following passage. The passage is followed by several questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A,B,C and D. Choose the one that fits best according to the information given in the passage.
 
It may be open to discussion which city is the most beautiful in the world. But in terms of " the most livable", Melbourne has ranked top in a survey done by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) in August. In fact, four cities Down Under are among the top ten most livable cities.
The climate in Australia is warm and mild, particularly in major coastal cities. As a result, people spend much time outdoors. They go to the beach, to the countryside, or play sports outdoors in fields. 
Take Melbourne for example. The city features many open green spaces and beautiful long beaches. Melburnians 
(people from Melbourne) have a strong love for sports. The city hosts the annual Australia Open, 
the Formula One Grand Prix, cricket, rugby and homegrown football. It is also home to museums, art exhibitions and drama festivals.
The comfortable environment has encouraged many people to migrate  to the country and Australia is known for being very multicultural or its cultural diversity .
"We have tried to introduce a sense of belonging in Australia," said Chris Bowen, the Australian Minister for Immigration . "Multiculturalism is about inviting every individual member of society to be everything they can be ... to develop as individuals."
This could be the reason behind another Australia quality that Guardian reporter Stephen Brook has noticed: Australians do patriotism  much better than the Brits.
"I once witnessed two Australian viewers at a tennis tournament show more support for the Aussie player than the rest of the British arena," he wrote.
It is also an Australian tradition to stand up for the  _ . In the 2000 Olympic Games, the Sydney public watches an African swimmer who was barely able to swim 50 meters. Even though most people in the stands knew that even they could have swum better than him at that point, they cheered his every stroke  as if he were on his way to a good medal. During the 2003 Rugby World Cup, the level of support they showed for the Japanese team surprised viewers since Japan had little hope of winning. 
"Australians don't need to be victorious in order to feel like a worthy person. When they cheer for the underdog, seeing other human beings having the courage to take on hardship, they get the emotional satisfaction they need," wrote a blogger on convictcreations.com, a website dedicated to Australian culture.

Children grow quickly, especially their feet, but many families cannot buy new shoes each time a child needs them. As a result, about 300 million children around the world go barefoot. Those children risk picking up diseases and parasites from the soil.
An American man may have a solution for those barefoot kids -- a shoe that grows with the child. Kenton Lee is the creator of The Shoe That Grows. He explains how the shoe works and how it is able to last so long.
"It grows in three places: the front; it can also grow on the side with Velcro; and on the back with our buckle. It can last up to five years. The bottom is compressed rubber like tire rubber. The top is just high-quality leather." The shoe comes in two sizes: small that fits children aged 4 to 9 and large for children aged 9 to 14.
Lee says he got the idea for the shoe while working as a volunteer in an orphanage in Kenya. "... and there was a little girl in a white dress walking next to me. And I just remember looking down and seeing how small her shoes were. They were just way too small for her feet. They were so small that she had to cut open the front of her shoes to let her toes stick out. And I just remember thinking, wouldn't it be nice if there were a pair of shoes that could grow with her feet?"
However, Lee says it was not easy to turn his idea into a reality. "I kept writing down I should do this because of this or because of that. All these reasons why it really was important for me to try to make the shoes that could grow and try to help." Finally, in 2009 Lee founded a non-profit organization called Because International. In the office of Because International, Lee keeps a pair of his own shoes to help him remember his promise. "I told myself I would not get new shoes until the idea was done. So, those are the shoes that I wore for a little over five years."

Generated quiz:
Question: A student is given a pair of shoes that do not fit. The student is told to wear the shoes until they do fit. The shoes should fit for at least one year. The shoes should not be too tight. The shoes should be loose enough to allow the child's foot to grow.

Global warming is causing more than 300,000 deaths and about $125 billion in economic losses each year, according to a report by the Global Humanitarian Forum, an organization led by Annan, the former United Nations secretary general.
The report, to be released Friday, analyzed data and existing studies of health, disaster, population and economic trends. It found that human-influenced climate change was raising the global death rates from illnesses including malnutrition   and heat-related health problems.
But even before its release, the report drew criticism from some experts on climate and risk, who questioned its methods and conclusions.
Along with the deaths, the report said that the lives of 325 million people, primarily in poor countries, were being seriously affected by climate change. It projected that the number would double by 2030.
Roger Pielke Jr., a political scientist at the University of Colorado, Boulder, who studies disaster trends, said the Forum's report was "a methodological embarrassment" because there was no way to distinguish deaths or economic losses related to human-driven global warming amid the much larger losses resulting from the growth in populations and economic development in vulnerable   regions. Dr. Pielke said that "climate change is an important problem requiring our utmost   attention." But the report, he said, "will harm the cause for action on both climate change and disasters because it is so deeply flawed  ."
However, Soren Andreasen, a social scientist at Dalberg Global Development Partners who supervised the writing of the report, defended it, saying that it was clear that the numbers were rough estimates. He said the report was aimed at world leaders, who will meet in Copenhagen in December to negotiate a new international climate treaty.
In a press release describing the report, Mr. Annan stressed the need for the negotiations to focus on increasing the flow of money from rich to poor regions to help reduce their vulnerability  to climate hazards while still curbing   the emissions of the heat-trapping gases. More than 90% of the human and economic losses from climate change are occurring in poor countries, according to the report.

I was dirty smelly hungry and some somewhere beneath all that, suntanned .It was the end of an Inter-Rail holiday.My body couldn't take any more punishment. My mind couldn't deal with any more foreign timetables, currencies or languages.
" _ ," I said, as I stepped onto home ground.I said exactly the same thing the following year.And the next, all I had to do was buy one train ticket and, because I was under twenty--five years old,I could spend a whole month going anywhere I wanted in Europe. Ordinary beds are never the same once you've learnt to sleep, in the passage of a train, the rhythm rocking you into a deep sleep.
Carrying all your possessions on your back  in a tucksack  makes you have a vefy basic approach to travel,and encourages incredible wastefulness that can lead  to burning socks that have become too anti-social ,and getting rid of books when finished.On the other hand, _ is entirely in the spirit of Inter--Rail,for common sense and reasoning can be thrown out of the window along with the paperback book and the socks.All it takes to achieve this carefree attitude is one of those tickets in your hand.
Any system that enables young people to travef through countries at a rate of more than one a day must be pretty social on that first trip,my friehds mad I were at first unaware of the possibilities of this type of train ticket,thinking it was just an inexpensive way of getting to and from our chosen camp-site in southern France.But the idea of non-stop travel proved too attractive,for there was always just one more country over the border,always that little bit further to go.And what did the extra miles cost us? Nothing.
We were not completely uninterested in culture.But this was a first holiday without parents,as it was for most other Inter-Railers,and in organizing our own timetable  we left out everything except the most available sights.This was the chance to escape the guided tour,an opportunity to do something different.I took great pride in the fact that.in many places,all I could be bothered to see was the view from the station.We were just there to get by,and to have good time doing so.In this we were not different from most of the other Inter-Raiders with whom we shared passage  floors,food and water,money and music.
The excitement of travel comes from the sudden reality of somewhere that was previously just a name.It is as if the city in which you arrive never actually existed until the train pulls in at the station and you are able to see it with your own tired eyes for the first time.

An English saying goes: " _ " That means we should relax after a day's hard work or we'll be unhealthy.
Many students know that if they want to get ideal jobs with good salaries, they must do well in high school so they can enter good universities. Therefore, they spend all day studying without time to relax.
However, not all students can go to top universities even if they work very hard. Students are pressurized by parents and teachers who are just concerned about their studies and exam scores while ignoring their hobbies and individual differences. As a result, students are forces to work harder and harder. Furthermore, there is pressure coming from students themselves. They realize they have a slim chance of getting into a top university as competition is fierce. So, they put a lot of stress on themselves and stay in a nervous state day after day. If they keep it up,   they'll suffer illnesses; both psychological and physical.
What students need is relaxation. This doesn't mean that they should give up their ambitions and stop studying hard. It means "work while you work, play while you play". If you can do this, you will improve your health greatly. You'll feel yourself suddenly fresh, just like recovering from a terrible illness. You'll find that your studies are not a burden  anymore.

Traditionally, women have fallen behind men in adoption of Internet technologies, but a study released yesterday by the Pew Internet & American Life Project found that women under age 65 now get ahead of men in Internet usage, though only by a few percentage points. But the survey also noted that the  _ between women and men on the Web is even greater among the 18-to-29 age group and African Americans.
The report, "How Women and Men Use the Internet", examined use by both sexes, looking at what men and women are doing online as well as their rate of adopting new Web-based technologies.
The report found that 86 percent of women aged 18 to 29 were online, compared with 80 percent of men in the same age group. Among African Americans, 60 percent of women are online, compared with 50 percent of men.
In other age groups, the disparity is only slight, with women outpacing men by 3 percentage points. However, among the older group, those age 65 and older, 34 percent of men are online, compared with 21 percent of women.

Iceland, an island just south of the Arctic Circle, has fairly mild winters,  thanks to warm ocean currents. Time your vacation here during the winter months to take advantage of off-season deals.
Off-season means good deals on flights, hotels and tours. You may also find that the locals are a bit friendlier and more welcoming when tourists aren't arriving in crowds.
In the winter months, there are less than seven hours of daylight; thus, chances are good you'll catch sight of the northern lights. Sunsets are also beautiful at this time, making for some great photo opportunities.
In Iceland, winter is the perfect time to hike glaciers, go ice climbing, explore caves made out of hardened lava  and much more. One of the most popular activities is off-roading  in a specially-equipped "super jeep".
Before booking your trip, be sure to check for volcano alerts. There are about 130 volcanoes on or around Iceland. Thirty-five of them are active. In 2010, a volcano named Eyjaallajokull exploded, sending clouds of ash up to four kilometers into the atmosphere. The ash drifted toward the UK and Europe. Because the ask could damage aircraft engines, airlines operating in the region were forced to cancel flights for six days. As a result, thousands of people were stuck in airports.
Recently, another volcano named Bardarbunga has become active, erupting ash into the air. Such events, if large enough, could prevent your trip from going ahead. So check the latest volcano news prior to making your reservations.

Wang Lu, 24, one of many students studying abroad who'll come home for work, majors in business & management studies at Edinburgh's Napier University. She had planned what to do after graduation in the UK: two years' work experience at a restaurant and a tour around Europe. But now her plans are up in the air.
         Following the UK Home Secretary's meeting on reform of the student immigration system, the UK government recently announced the end of the post-study work visa from April 2012. This will force tens of thousands of Chinese students to leave the UK after graduation.
         Sadly, the domestic job market doesn't welcome them with open arms. A report by Tigtag.com at the end of 2011 showed that over 35 percent of students admitted that they have employment problems.
         "Returning students often have fluent English, creative minds and a serious attitude toward work," said Zhang Tingwen, an HR expert in ChinaHR.com. "But lack of work experience is a big problem." Xia Lei, an HR manager, responded to Zhang. "We need people who can work for us. We don't need people from big name universities to attract customers".
         Difference in work practices is another problem that worries employers, Zhang pointed out. "Some returning students might be used to Western ways of dealing with people and things."
         Huang Shanshan, 25, got a job in a communication company in Shenzhen.   "I once worked part-time in UK. My colleagues ate snacks when they felt hungry, even during working time or in meetings." Huang brought some cakes to the office and ate them.

Golf in the USA was until quite recently the hobby of old,middle class white men.Not any more.The fact that the class,age and race barriers that existed in the sport have finally been  broken down is due almost entirely to two people.Tiger Woods and Michelle Wie.
Tiger Woods was born in California in 1975 and is one of the greatest golfers of all time.His ethnic background is marvelously rich and varied.His father Earl was of mixed of black,Chinese and Native American ancestry and his mother Kultida,who was originally from Thailand,also had Chinese and Dutch forefathers.
Woods became a professional golfer in 1996 and,less than a year later,astonished the world easily winning the prestigious Masters Colf Tournament,an annual event which takes place at the Augusta Golf Club in Georgia,USA.At 21,he was the youngest golfer ever to win the tournament,but much more important,he was also the first Asian American to do it.
Woods'amazing achievement is put into perspective when you realize that until 1990,no non-white American had ever been allowed to join Augusta Golf Club.Even in 2000,it only had two black members.In fact,in 1977,Clifford Roberts,the chairman of the club and founder of the Masters Tournament,proclaimed:"As long as 1 am alive,golfers will be white and caddies
 will be black."Roberts died not long after making this racist remark...

"I would almost rather see you dead," Robert S. Cassatt, a leading banker of Philadelphia, shouted when his twenty-year-old eldest daughter announced that she wanted to become an artist. In the 19th century, playing at drawing or painting on dishes was all right for a young lady, but serious work in art was not. And when the young lady's family ranked  among the best of Philadelphia's social families, such an idea could not even be considered.
That was how Mary Cassatt, born in 1844, began her struggle as an artist. She did not tremble before her father's anger. Instead, she opposed him with courage and at last made him change his mind. Mary Cassatt gave up her social position and all thought of a husband and a family, which in those times was unthinkable for a young lady. In the end, after long years of hard work and perseverance , she became America's most important woman artist and the internationally recognized leading woman painter of the time.

London Heathrow is the biggest airport in the UK, and it also handles more international passenger traffic than any other airport in the world. For this reason, enlargement was planned and on 27th March a fifth terminal opened to help to deal with the many passengers that pass through the airport. The new terminal has taken a long time to plan and build. The idea was first proposed back in the 1980s. The opening of it has been talked about widely in the media in the UK and expectations were high for the PS4.3 billion project.
   However, in spite of long preparations at Terminal 5 ahead of the grand opening, things soon went into a mess. There were problems from the very beginning as staff had difficulties finding car parking spaces and getting through security to get into the building. This consequently caused a delay when passengers started to arrive and large numbers of staff were not in place. Long passenger queues formed and the slow start meant that everyone had to play catch-up from the beginning. Staffs were having problems using the new systems and a baggage operator told the BBC, it was all "shambles   the moment the doors opened". The terminal has been designed to handle 12,000 bags an hour but due to a reported "lack of training and essential support that was promised", a backlog   of luggage soon appeared.
   By lunchtime on that first day, 20 flights had been cancelled to try to alleviate the problems. Flights continued to be cancelled in the days following the opening and up to 28,000 bags have now had to be placed in temporary storage. The British Airline, the only airline operating at Terminal 5 says it is working to clear the backlog, but the negative publicity caused by the shambles has not helped the airport or the airline's reputation at all.

Generated quiz:
Question: A new terminal opened at Heathrow Airport in March. Many flights were cancelled on the first day. What was the main reason for the cancellations?
Answer: the new terminal was not ready
MC option A) the new terminal was not ready 
MC option B) the new terminal was not big enough 
MC option C) the new terminal was too small 
MC option D) the new terminal was too big

Have you heard of the scandal that happened in one of Great Britain's biggest supermarket chains called Tesco? The British love Tesco as it sells very cheap products and it can be found on almost every corner of a British city or town.
On January 15th 2013 food inspectors discovered 30 % horsemeat in a certain brand of frozen beefburgers that were mostly sold by Tesco in the UK and Ireland.
In times of social media like Facebook and Twitter the news has spread fast and customers have been very concerned about what the food they buy actually contains. Tesco said it had taken away the burgers from the shop shelves immediately, and apologized to their customers. They also promised that they would find out what exactly happened and that they would work harder than ever so this would never happen again. Customers are also able to return the beefburgers and get a refund, that is, their money back.
However, it will be hard for Tesco to get the people's trust back. Just imagine buying lovely beefburgers that you fry at home and suddenly you find out that you have actually eaten horsemeat! In this case not only horse lovers will be upset!
By the way, why are British people so shocked about eating horsemeat? In history, horses have played great roles as working animals and as an important means of transport. When Britons of today think of horses, they think of majestic animals or cute pets rather than meat.
But this is not the only reason for the protest: Customers also want to be sure that the products they buy contain what it says on the label. Hopefully, supermarkets can avoid mistakes like that in the future. Maybe there should be stricter regulations and more controls of our food? Otherwise we will soon find ourselves eating panda meat instead of pork and parrot instead of chicken. So the next time you are in a supermarket maybe check the ingredients of your food before you buy it or you could get a nasty surprise ...

Generated quiz:
Question: If a food contains more than ten percent of an ingredient, the food is most likely to be _.
Answer: a mixture
MC option A) a mixture 
MC option B) a compound 
MC option C) a substance 
MC option D) a compound substance

Farmer John and Farmer Bob were neighbors. For more than 30 years, they had been getting along very well.
Then their good relationship broke. It began with a small thing, then bitter words, and then weeks of silence. One morning Farmer John woke up to find a stream between the two farms. "It must be Bob," John thought.
Then one day there was a knock on John's door. He opened it to find a carpenter  standing at the doorway.
"I'm looking for a few days' work," the carpenter said.
"I do have a job for you," John said. "Look across the stream at that farm. That's my neighbor Bob. He dug a stream between the two farms. I want you to build a fence--an 8-foot fence. I don't want to see his place or his face any more. I don't have such a neighbor!"
The carpenter said, "I think I know what to do, sir, and I'll be able to do a job that pleases you."
Farmer John helped the carpenter get the materials ready and then he was off for the day.
About sunset when the farmer returned, the carpenter had just finished his job. The farmer's eyes opened wide. There was no fence there at all!
It was a bridge! And the neighbor, Bob, was coming across, with his hand outstretched . "Hi, John! _ 
Then they met in the middle, taking each other's hands. "I'm terribly sorry for what I have said and done. We should be good to each other," said Farmer Bob.
Then they turned to see the carpenter, who was ready to go. "No, wait! Stay a few days. I have a lot of other jobs for you," said Farmer John. "I'd love to stay," the carpenter said, "but I have more bridges to build."

Are you a big fan of pirate  stories? Do you know how to talk like a pirate? You can have fun on September 19th. This special holiday is called International Talk Like A Pirate Day. It was invented in 1995 by two young Americans, John Baur and Mark Summers.
These two good friends came up with this idea when they were playing racquetball, and began to talk like pirates. At that moment, they thought, "Young people are interested in pirate, but there is no such a chance for people to get together to share it. Why not have a day when everybody talks like a pirate?" They decided to make September 19th the date. Since then, Baur and Summers have tried hard to promote Talk Like A Pirate Day. As Baur said, "We've talked like pirates, and encouraged several of our friends to do so every September 19th."
At first, this day was only known by a few people. In 2002, Baur and Summers sent a letter about their invented holiday to Dave Barry. This columnist really liked their idea. He promoted the holiday and made it known to more and more people. Now, it has really become an international holiday. On Talk Like A Pirate Day, you need to dress like a pirate. You should wear a big hat or maybe cover one of your eyes. You can pretend to be any kind of pirate that you can find in any story or movie.
Having fun and being relaxed are not the only best things about the holiday. Young people share the same interest and childhood dreams that day. That's why it is welcomed by so many people, especially young people.
Unlike traditional holidays, International Talk Like A Pirate Day is a brand new holiday which is invented by the youth themselves and celebrated by themselves too. Because of Baur and Summers' imagination and creativity, thousands of young people's pirate dream come true. Next time, when you have a good idea, why not share it with your fiends and insist on your belief? Maybe you can create another wonderful holiday for the youth in the future.

Many adults in the United States can remember crying the nursery rhyme in the street "Hot cross buns!" But only a few people realize this was an early form of advertising.
Written advertisements probably began with hieroglyphics more than three thousand years ago, but only a few people could read these symbols. So merchants made signs with pictures or hung their tools over their doors to identify their businesses.
In the time of the Roman Empire, wall paintings were a popular form of advertisement. An ad for a play, or some other performance was painted on part of a building or on a wall around a city. People often advertised a house for rent or a freshwater bath in this way, too.
Today, large wall signs are still used for outdoor advertising. But outdoor advertising is only a small fraction of the total advertising. About forty per -cent of all ads are printed in daily newspapers. Radio commercials also provide this kind of information. Some people think they are the best form of advertising because radio broadcasts reach almost everyone in a nation.
Advertisements in magazines and on television reach many people, too. However, usually only large companies can advertise on a national network, because TV commercials shown across the country can cost many thousands of dollars.
Then there are ads that are almost part of daily living. If you use public transportation, you will see large printed ads, called ear cards, on buses and taxis and in trains. Ads are painted on the trucks that deliver products people are buying or selling.

Question: A company that makes cars advertises on buses. How many people does this advertisement reach?

Facebook users may feel socially successful in the web world but they are more likely to perform poorly in exams. The majority of students who use Facebook every day are doing badly compared with those who don't. About 83% of British 16 to 24-year-old people are using social networking site such as Facebook and MySpace, to keep in touch with friends and organize their social activities.
"Our study shows people who spend more time on Facebook spend less time studying," said Aryn Karpinski, a researcher. "Every generation has its distractions , but I think Facebook is a unique phenomenon." Karpinski and a colleague questioned 219 US undergraduates and graduates about their study and general Internet use, as well as their specific use of Facebook. They found 65% of Facebook users accessed their account daily, checking it several times to see if they had received new messages. The amount of time spent on Facebook at each log-in  varied from just a few minutes to more than an hour.
Some UK students have already realized the potential danger. Daisy Jones, 21, an undergraduate, realized the time she was spending on Facebook was threatening her grades, urging her to deactivate  her account, "I was in the library and tried to write a 2,000-word essay when I realized my Facebook habit had got out of hand," she said. "I couldn't resist going online, when thinking about it. Before you know it , a couple of minutes have turned into a couple of hours and you haven't written a word."
Jones is among the few to have realized the risks. 79% of the users, however, believed the time they spent on the site had no impact on their work. The CEO of Facebook said, "There is also academic research that shows the benefits of services like Facebook. It's in the hands of students to decide how to spend their time."

Generated quiz:
Question: Students who use Facebook are more likely to _.

A jobless man applied for the position of "office boy" at Microsoft. The HR manager interviewed him and then watched him cleaning the floor as a test.
"You are employed," he said. "Give me your e-mail address and I'll send you the application to fill in, as well as date when you may start. "
The man replied, "But I don't have a computer, neither an e-mail. "
"I'm sorry," said the HR manager. "If you don't have an e-mail, that means you do not exist. And who doesn't exist cannot have the job. "

One warm September night, Mira had come down to the beach to enjoy the night air. She closed her eyes and listened to the waves. Suddenly, she could hear another sound, so she opened her eyes and looked down at the sand. It was moving! All of a sudden she could see a tiny head coming out. Then a turtle  appeared! One by one they struggled out of their underground nests. Mira looked in surprise at the baby turtles.
Mira knew the turtles should head towards the waves and swim away, so she was puzzled when they began to pull themselves towards the dunes . Suddenly, she remembered something her grandmother had told her.
"Sea turtles bury their eggs on the beach every year in April and in September. Those baby turtles hatch  and head back down to the sea. But some of them never make it. Sometimes they die going across the dunes, trying to find those bright lights on the houses. Every day there are more houses being built on the dunes. That means more and more lights to confuse the sea turtles."
Mira looked out across the dunes at her house. Mira saw her mother and father, sitting on the porch . She could see them because her house had two bright lights that lit up the porch.
Mira began to run to her house and shouted, "The turtles are hatching! We have to help the turtles!" With these words, Mira ran into the house and turned off the bright porch lights.
In a rush she was off running down the dunes with her whole family following her. They reached the beach just in time to see the tiny turtles slipping silently into the waves. Mira watched as the last turtle entered the water. As the turtle swam away, it looked back at Mira. In the moonlight, Mira thought she saw it smile.

Life is too short to waste a moment, so while you still have time, let your hair down, remove that "boring" tag in your so-called life and start making it worthwhile. Below are some tips that will help you live a wonderful life.
1. Keep a Positive Attitude. Enjoy what you have and work on getting the things you desire. Psychologists believe that optimism   is a good defense against unhappiness, so it is better to keep your optimism alive. Feeling sad about your life will only make you sadder, so be happy.
2. Don't Be Afraid to Take Risks. Life is all about taking risks, and that's the exciting part of it. Challenges and failure are part of life. Once you learn how to take risks, you'll soon realize how good it feels not to let moments pass you by.
3. You only have one life, so make it worthwhile. Being unwilling to let the past go just keeps you away from the things you should be enjoying at the present.
4. List the Things You Want to Do. Stop lazing around and give yourself something to be busy with. Write down a list of all the things you want to do and make a timeline, not to stress you out, but to remind you of your goals. So don't put limits to yourself because you'll never know what may happen.
5. Try Out Something New. Getting into something or trying something unfamiliar to you may seem scary, but nothing can make you feel happier than being able to overcome your fear. Who knows? You might enjoy it! The world is a big place and there are still lots of things waiting to be explored by you. Go to a foreign place where you know no one.

Or they might use a computer to help them in their search for a soul mate by joining an online dating service. Some people have even tried to find their perfect match through game shows on television. Many of these TV dating shows, including The Bachelor andWho Wants to Marry Multimillionaire?, have proved to be popular, with millions of viewers watching each week to find out which of the contestants  will find true love.
Of all these game shows, perhaps the one with the most unexpected ending was Mr. Right, which was shown in England in 2002. On the show, a bachelor, thirty-five-year-old Lance Gerrard-Wright, dated fifteen women to find the one who was his ideal partner. The host of the show was Ulrika Jonsson, an English celebrity   originally from Sweden. For seven weeks on the show, Lance took turns going on dates with each of the women, taking them to expensive restaurants and romantic locations. He even met the women's families and introduced them to his own. Then at the end of each episode , he would choose between one and three of the contestants with whom he had felt the least compatible , and say goodbye to them.
At one point during the series, one contestant volunteered to leave because she said she didn't find him attractive. After two dates she said she had had enough, and she couldn't see it working, "He wasn't my cup of tea." In another episode the woman he was on a date with burst into tears when he called her by another girl's name. "You called me by another girl's name. I can't believe you did that. I really liked you," she said in tears.
But in the final episode, the woman he eventually chose decided she didn't want to marry him after all. "I think you've chosen me because you have to choose someone," she said. Maybe this was because she already knew he had fallen in love with the show's host!
After leaving the show, Gerrard-Wright and Jonsson were seen dining together and attending parties around London more and more often. Finally, on May 1, 2003, Gerrard-Wright proposed to Jonsson on the steps of St. Paul's Cathedral. And she accepted his proposal right away, although she had to make sure that her two children from previous relationships--an eight-year-old son, Cameron, and a two-year-old daughter, Bo. agreed to the marriage. Luckily, they did. Gerrard-Wright said, "In the end the show did work for me. I grabbed an opportunity to get a girlfriend and I did. Ulrika's amazing"
The happy couple finally got married at Jonsson's home in Sweden on the island of Varmdo. They wanted to keep the ceremony small, so only forty people were invited, including family and friends. There was some gossip at the time that Jonsson's friends who did not receive invitations to the wedding felt upset. But the bride and groom did not let that ruin their wedding day.
Has Ulrika Jonsson finally found Mr. Right? Only time will tell. But none of the guests at the wedding could deny the happiness in the couple's eyes as the bride and groom left the wedding ceremony with the music of Stevie Wonder playing in the background, "Seen a lot of things in this old world. When I touched them, they did nothing, girl. Ooh baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours."

A 13-year-old American boy on Saturday became the youngest climber to conquer Mount Everest, the world's highest mountain.
Jordan Romero from Big Bear, California, climbed up the 8,850-meter summit   from the Tibetan side. On the same day, a Nepali   man, Apa Sherpa, broke his own world record of climbing Everest when he reached the summit for the twentieth time. Apa Shepa's team set off from Nepal's capital, Kathmandu, last month, heading for the base camp on the Chinese side of the mountain.
"The team has just called in and believe that they are standing on top of Mt. Everest," Romero's blog said. "Their dreams have now come true. Everyone is happy."
The climbing has put Romero one step closer to reaching his goal of climbing the highest mountains on all seven continents  . "It is just a goal." Romero said. He had already climbed five peaks  , and needs to climb only Vinson Massif, the highest peak in Antarctica, to hit his goal.
The youngest person before to climb Everest was 16-year-old Temba Tsheri Sherpa of Nepal. Romero climbed together with a team including his father Paul and three local guides. He wanted to pick a small piece of rock from the top of the world and wear it in a necklace. While Nepal insists that anyone planning to climb Mount Everest must be at least 16, China does not have any age restrictions  . Some mountain climbers haven't agreed with the Romero family for letting him try it but his father said the climbing from the Chinese side is less dangerous.

Vampires  , creatures of myth, have been around in one form or another for centuries. Terrifying but also attractive, they are as popular in the early 21st century as ever, as the current popularity of Twilight series, and its hero Edward Cullen, show. Vampires first appeared in fiction in the 1700s; in 1895 Irish novelist Bram Stoker published Dracula, introducing the world's most famous vampire.
But just what is it about these drinkers of human blood that continues to fascinate us? Speaking to Eric Lewis of the Times and Transcript website, academic Deborah Wells said that vampires are "culturally adaptive ". "We create very different vampires to fit different times. Edward Cullen is not the same as Count Dracula," she said.
Different as they are, Wells believes vampires are "the perfect containers into which we can pour our current cultural anxieties". Bram Stoker's Dracula is powerful, yet old and physically ugly. Stoker's book dealt with fear of the fall of the British Empire, real fears in the day in which it was written.
According to the website Bookpages, today's vampires have all our cultural desires, money, power and sexual attraction. Represented by Cullen, they are noble, handsome young men whom women find irresistible . What's more, vampires challenge traditional ideas about death, science and parental authority . This may be why teenagers are drawn to vampire tales.
"In many ways, the vampire story shows up teenage concerns," said Wells. "The emotional intensity   of the relationship with the vampire matches the intensity of how it feels to have your first real love affairs. Your first real love, it really feels like life and death."

If you're a man and you're reading this, congratulations: you're a survivor. According to statistics, you're more than twice as likely to die of skin cancer than a woman, and nine times more likely to die of AIDS. Even if you make it to the end of your natural term, about 78 years for men in Australia, you'll die on average five years before a woman.
  There're many reasons for this--typically, men take more risks than women and are more likely to drink and smoke--but perhaps more importantly, men don't go to the doctor.
  "Men aren't seeing doctors as often as they should," says Dr. Gullotta. "This is particularly so for the over-40s, when chances of diseases are higher ."
  Gullotta says a healthy man should visit the doctor every year or two. For those over 45, it should be at least once a year.
  Two months ago Gullotta saw a 50-year-old man who had delayed doing anything about his smoker's cough for a year.
  "When I finally saw him it had already spread and he later died from lung cancer," he says. "Earlier detection and treatment may not have cured him, but it would have prolonged   his life."
  According to a recent survey, 95% of women aged between 15 and early 40s see a doctor once a year, compared to 70% of men in the same age group.
  "A lot of men think they're invincible  ," Gullotta says. "They only come in when a friend drops dead on the golf course and they think, 'Geez, if it could happen to him, ...'"
  Then there's the ostrich approach. "Some men are scared of what might be there and would rather not know," says Dr, Ross Cartmill.
  "Most men get their cars serviced more often than they service their bodies," Cartmill says. He believes most diseases that commonly affect men could be found by regular check-ups.
Regular check-ups for men would put strain   on the public purse, Cartmill says. "But prevention is cheaper in the long run than having to treat the diseases. Besides, the final cost is far greater; it's called premature  death."

Ban Fur? Then Why Not Leather?
Much to the displeasure of some local businesses, the City Council in West Hollywood, California, voted without opposition last week to ban the sale of fur products. Should laws be involved in this issue? Is it unfair to ban sales of fur, but not sales of leather and hides  ?
Animals Do Not Have Rights
By Tibor R. Machan
My view is that animals do not have basic rights. It is a matter of ethics   and not of the laws of human societies. If animals had such rights as human beings do, they would have to be held responsible for killing fellow animals in the wild. That way of thinking about animals makes a category mistake. Using animals, including their fur or organs, to improve people's lives is acceptable.
A Small Step Against Cruelty
By Kate Carter
Both fur and leather are the skins of dead animals. Why should we think that the lovable furry ones deserve more of a life than the less pleasing ones? Some say leather is  less cruel because it's a byproduct   of the meat industry. But this isn't really true. Some cheap leather may be a byproduct of the meat industry, but often it's the other way round. In South Africa, where there is a developing market for ostrich farms, the skins account for roughly 80 percent of the slaughtered  birds' value, a mere 20 percent of which comes from the meat.
"Who" Are You Wearing?
By Marc Bekoff
West Hollywood's ban is a move in the right direction. However, we must work to ban the sales of leather and hides, too. Furs come from animals who are attacked to become clothing, while some leather and hides come from slaughterhouse  animals. We must remember that when people choose to wear fur, leather and hides, they are wearing formering conscious beings. So it's a matter of who they are wearing, not what they are wearing because these animals must be referred to as who and not what or that.

Generated quiz:
Question: If a city bans the sale of fur, but not leather, what is the most likely reason given?
Answer: fur comes from animals that were killed
MC option A) fur comes from animals that were killed 
MC option B) leather is a byproduct of the meat industry 
MC option C) leather is a renewable resource

Hair has always been an important sign of beauty, especially true for women.Next to the face, hair is one of the main qualities people look for when they consider a woman's beauty.Whether long or short, curly or straight, hair often gets a lot of attention.
Each hair grows independently of other hairs.Not all hairs experience the same period of growth at the same time.During the period of active growth, which is called Anagen, hair grows at a rate of about or one centimeter a month.About eighty five percent of hair follicles  are going through this process at any given time.This period can last from two to six years.
The Catagen period of hair growth comes next.It is then that hair growth begins to slow down.This period usually lasts two or three weeks.Finally, hair growth comes to a complete stop and the hairs begin to fall out.This period is known as Telogen.Once the Telogen period has ended, the hair growth process begins again.
So what happens when a person has trouble growing hair or suffers from hair loss? Your genes control how fast or how long your hair will grow.Some people have a longer than usual anagen growth period.These people may be able to grow more hair than the average person.
However, others struggle to grow shoulder length hair.These people have a shorter than normal anagen period.
Your health can also affect hair growth.Poor nutrition can cause some hair follicles to stop growing or cause the hairs that grow to become weak or thin.Problems with hair growth can result from thyroid (^?K JSO problems or other conditions.Health experts say people who experience a sudden increase in hair loss should seek medical advice.

Generated quiz:
Question: What is the average amount of time for hair to grow?

It was 11 pm. Donald Lubeck was lying in bed. Outside, lightning lit up the sky, and thunder shook the house. Suddenly he heard the smoke alarm sounding. Lubeck walked down to see what happened; he opened the door to the kitchen, and flames  just went out. The sudden strong wind from the doorway immediately created a large fire from a small one, probably caused by lightning. Lubeck went back to his bedroom to call 911. "I felt safe because the room had a separate stairway," he explains. The phone didn't work, and when Lubeck tried to go down the stairway, he was stopped by a wall of flames. Lubeck realized he was in trouble. His daughter and granddaughters, who lived with him, were away for the night. 
Up a hill lived Lubeck's neighbors, Jeremie Wentworth and his wife. From his house, Wentworth saw the black smoke. He rushed out, and headed towards Lubeck's house. He knew Lubeck lived in the house. He dialed 911. On the phone, the 911 worker warned Wentworth not to enter the house. "But I told the worker, "Sorry, but I'm going in. I can hear Lubeck shouting "Help me!" I can't let myself do nothing in this situation," /he says. "I went in and shouted, "Donald, where are you?" Then I had to run outside to catch my breath." After one more try inside the house, he gave up. Then the wind parted the smoke just enough for him to see Lubeck on the second-floor bedroom. But there was no way to get to him."I finally noticed a ladder," says Wentworth. He set it against the wall and pulled Lubeck down. Just seconds later the floor fell down. 
Within the year, Lubeck and his family built a new two-story house at the place. Wentworth and Lubeck don't run into each other often, but Lubeck now knows that if he ever needs help, Wentworth will be there.

In 1974, after filling out fifty applications, going through four interviews, and winning one offer, I took what I could get ----- a teaching job at what I considered a distant wild area: western New Jersey. My characteristic optimism was alive only when I reminded myself that I would be doing what I had wanted to do since I was fourteen ------- teaching English.
School started, but I felt more and more as if I were in a foreign country. Was this rural area really New Jersey? My students took a week off when hunting season began. I was told they were also frequently absent in late October to help their fathers make hay on the farms. I was a young woman from New York City, who thought that "Make hay while the sun shines" just meant to have a good time.
But, still, I was teaching English. I worked hard, taking time off only to eat and sleep. And then there was my sixth-grade class ---- seventeen boys and five girls who were only six years younger than me. I had a problem long before I knew it. I was struggling in my work as a young idealistic teacher. I wanted to make literature come alive and to promote a love of the written word. The students wanted to throw spitballs and whisper dirty words in the back of the room.
In college I had been taught that a successful educator should ignore bad behavior. So I did, confident that, as the textbook had said, the bad behavior would disappear as I gave my students positive attention. It sounds reasonable, but the text evidently ignored the fact that humans, particularly teenagers, rarely seem reasonable. By the time my boss, who was also my taskmaster, known to be the strictest, most demanding, most quick to fire inexperienced teachers, came into the classroom to observe me, the students exhibited very little good behavior to praise.
My boss sat in the back of the room. The boys in the class were making animal noises, hitting each other while the girls filed their nails or read magazines. I just pretended it all wasn't happening, and went on lecturing and tried to ask some inspiring questions. My boss, sitting in the back of the classroom, seemed to be growing bigger and bigger. After twenty minutes he left, silently. Visions of unemployment marched before my eyes.
I felt mildly victorious that I got through the rest of class without crying, but at my next free period I had to face him. I wondered if he would let me finish out the day. I walked to his office, took a deep breath, and opened the door.
He was sitting in his chair, and he looked at me long and hard. I said nothing. All I could think of was that I was not an English teacher; I had been lying to myself, pretending that everything was fine.
When he spoke, he said simply, without accusation, "You had nothing to say to them."
"You had nothing to say to them". he repeated." No wonder they are bored. Why not get to the meat of literature and stop talking about symbolism. Talk with them, not at them. And more important, why do you ignore their bad behavior"? We talked. He named my problems and offered solutions. We role-played. He was the bad student, and I was the forceful, yet, warm teacher.
As the year progressed, we spent many hours discussing literature and ideas about human beings and their motivations. He helped me identify my weaknesses and strengths. In short, he made a teacher of me by teaching me the reality of Emerson's words: "The secret to education lies in respecting the pupil."
Fifteen years later I still drive that same winding road to the same school. Thanks to the help I received that difficult first year, the school is my home now.

Is It OK to Snap   Your Food?
Have you ever taken a snap of a luxurious cake or photographed a juicy steak when you eat in restaurants? You may want to share what you eat with your friends or just post part of your daily life onto the Internet. However, such action may be very annoying  to other diners, or even to chefs and restaurant owners. Currently, more and more people begin to consider " foodstagramming" as very silly and a bad manner.
In many restaurants, diners complain of being blinded by flasher , snapped without their permission and disturbed by people climbing on to chairs for a better angle. Even chefs and restaurant owners are annoyed at food photography. A Michelin-starred  chef said, "It's hard to build a memorable evening when flashes are flying every six minutes."
At the start of 2013, the debate on whether it is OK to take photographs of your food in restaurants seemed to swing   towards a definite "no." According to several chefs in New York City, some restaurants there have started banning customers from taking photos of their food. Policies around the ban of food photography vary from restaurant to restaurant, ranging from restrictions on using a flash to outright  bans. If other restaurants follow such policies, it may signal the death of " foodstagramming".
Nevertheless, instead of banning food photography, some restaurants are offering food photography courses. In Spain, the restaurant group Grupo Gourmet has started running a " Fotografia para foodies" course to instruct its customers to better take food pictures. The course teaches customers to take photos in a proper way without disturbing other dinners, such as never use a flash.

Warm weather brought by El Nino has had mixed effects on animals in usually snowy places in North America, including New England, according to an Associated Press article.
Some animals seem to benefit from having a chance to gather more food before winter, and from expending less energy in daily survival mode. Others, like snowshoe hares, are put at center stage in predators'  view when they lack snow for disguising their white fur -- not a good thing for them, of course.
Black bears, on the other hand, have been keeping busy gathering nuts and apples, when they would normally have settled into their winter homes by now. Vermont and Massachusetts officials have asked residents to wait till snow falls to take out their bird feeders for the sake of safety, the article said.
"We suggest waiting for 6 or more inches of snow that lasts before taking out your bird feeders, especially if you have been visited in the past by bears or if there are sightings of bears in your neighborhood,"Forrest Hammond, Vermont Fish and Wildlife's bear biologist, said in the article."Due to lack of snow and frozen ground, birds are able to seek food in fields and forests for theirnatural foods."
Snow amounts can also determine how comfortable bears are and how quickly they consume their accumulated fat during hibernation , noted Hammond in the article. This is because snow covers and traps them in their winter homes, and also hides them from predators.

You could feel sorry for Alberto Torres, who is blind. The last thing he remembers seeing was his daughter being born 13 years ago. Then the world went blank; he can only imagine what his only child looks like now, as a teenaged honor student. Bad luck is no stranger to this warm and thoughtful 37-year-old man. His mother died of cancer when he was 4, and his father, who was often ill, had to give him up to the care of the state when he was 11. He later worked for 19 years in a workshop making household goods, deathly boring work. Earlier this month, Alberto Torres's wife, who had just been laid off from her job, had to have a breast removed due to cancer and now faces a year of radiation treatments. Things seemed always to go from almost incredibly bad to worse. Even Mr. Torres's good luck has a dark side: Five years ago, his lovely guide dog pulled him out of the path of a truck. Mr. Torres was not hurt. The dog was killed.
But Mr. Torres does not feel sorry for himself. "These are just little bumps you have to go over in your life," he said. At 5 a.m. on a recent morning, we caught up with Mr. Torres at a subway stop in Brooklyn, New York, near where he lives in a third-floor apartment (with no elevator). He had been up since 3 a.m., feeding his new dog, making coffee, getting ready. "When you're blind, it takes a little longer to do things," he said.
Mr. Torres was beginning his two-hour trip to his job developing film in the X-ray department of the emergency room of the Bronx hospital. He would take the G train to Queens Plaza station to the R train, heading towards Manhattan. He would then ride the R train to 59th Street where he would walk upstairs to switch to the Number 6 train. At one point along the journey, he might chat with a stranger. At another, someone would pat his dog, calling him by name. People offered assistance, even seats. At 125th Street, Mr. Torres would transfer to the Number 4 train by crossing the platform. At 149th Street, he would go down to the Number 2. He would take that to East 180th Street where he nearly always has a long wait for his final train, to Pelham Parkway. Then he and his dog would walk 20 minutes to the hospital.
It was a hard job to come by. Before he got the job, Mr. Torres was determined to escape the workshop run by an organization dedicated to help people who can't see. He wanted a job developing X-ray film, something that everyone must do in the dark. He had to handle the long trip, as well as the work. "Our philosophy here is that blind people can do just about anything except drive buses," it was the thinking about disabled people at the Bronx hospital. "We find what a person can do rather than what he can't do," said the hospital's director.
One day a while ago marked the first anniversary of Mr. Torres's hiring. He developed 150 or so X-rays, his usual output, to celebrate. Mr. Torres works by himself in a small, dark room that smells of chemicals. He cannot wear gloves, because he needs to feel. It is hard work, related to emergency of lives. His immediate supervisor says he trusts him 100%. Mr. Torres makes $20,000 a year. But his motivation goes beyond money. "If I start feeling like a victim, that makes me bitter. And why be bitter? That makes you go into a hole and stay there." he said. "I'm not doing anything out of the ordinary," insisted Mr. Torres as he quickly completed the task.

We might not be alone in the universe. Actually, it may be confirmed as a very crowded place by new computer models developed to help identify habitable planets.
Estimates of places where life can exist have been based on the possibility of them having surface water. But software recently developed by the Aberdeen University allows researchers to identify planets with underground water kept liquid by heat from planets.
Water is fundamental for life and planets too close to the sun lose water to the atmosphere through evaporation. On the other hand, planets located in distant reaches from their star have their surface water locked away as ice.
Sean McMahon, who is carrying out the work, explained: "Traditionally people have said that if a planet is in this Goldilocks zone--not too hot and not too cold--then it can have liquid water on its surface and be habitable."
But this concept might change when considering that planets can receive two sources of heat--heat direct from the star and heat generated deep inside the planet.
It is easy to observe it in our own planet. As you go down through the crust   of the Earth, the temperature gets higher and higher. Even when the surface is frozen, water can exist below ground.
There could be immense quantities of water in fact--full of primitive life.
Professor John Parnell, also from Aberdeen University said: "There is a significant habitat for microorganisms below the surface of the Earth, extending down several kilometres".
"And some believe that the majority of life on Earth could even reside in this deep biosphere."
So the Aberdeen team are developing models to predict which distant planets might harbour underground reservoirs of liquid water with the possibility of alien life.

Generated quiz:
Question: a planet that is too hot for life to exist
Answer: no liquid water
MC option A) no liquid water 
MC option B) only ice caps 
MC option C) only volcanoes 
MC option D) only solid land masses

There's a widespread perception  in the United States that a university degree is the key to success. But a growing number of educators now say there are other possibilities, especially for students who might not succeed at university level.
This is not a traditional classroom. At the apprentice program run by the Plumbers and Steamfitters Union in the state of Maryland, Travis Strawderman and other students make money while they learn. "I \t's completely changed my life around," he said. "I've been able to pay off all my debts. I can say I'm actually responsible enough to have my own family."
Strawderman's five-year program teaches him technical skills free of charge. He says he considered university, but it didn't interest him. Economics Professor Robert Lerman says Strawderman is not alone. "A lot of people are bored in high school," Lerman stated. "They leave high school because they are bored. They want to do something besides sitting in a classroom." Lerman says the education system in the United States in too focused on pushing students to attend university. "What we're doing now is we're doing now is we're saying unless you learn in this way you don't really have the chance for a rewarding career," he said.
But Chad Aldeman, an analyst, says studies show the longer students saty in school the better chance they have at having a high paying and stable career. "If you only are a high school graduate your wages are going to drop over your lifetime-as opposed to a college degree," he said. "The college degree is really and insurance policey against unemployment and against low wages."

Where is that noise coming from? Not sure? Try living with your eyes closed for a few years. 
Blind people are better at locating sounds than people who can see, a new study says, without the benefits of vision the ears seem to work much better. 
Previous studies have shown that blind people are better than others at reaching out and touching the sources of sounds that are close by. Researchers from the University of Montreal wanted to see if blind people were also better at locating sounds that are far away. 
Twenty-three blind people participated in the study. All had been sightless for at least 20 years. Fourteen of them had lost their vision before age 11. the rest went blind after age 16. The experiment also included 10 people who could see but were wearing blind-folds. 
In one task, volunteers had to pick the direction of a sound coming from about 3 metres away. When the sound was in front of them or slightly off center in front, both groups performed equally well. 
When sounds came from the side or the back, however, the blind group performed much better than the blindfolded group. The participants who had been blind since childhood did slightly better than those who lost their sight later. 
Recognizing the locations of distant sounds can be a matter of life-or-death for blind people, say the researchers. Crossing the street, for instance, is much harder when you can't see the cars coming.
Still, the researchers were surprised by how well the blind participants did, especially those who went blind after age 16. In another experiment, the scientists also found that parts of the brain that normally deal with visual information became active in locating sound in the people who were blind by age 11. These brain parts didn't show sound-location activity in the other group of blind people or in the sighted people. The scientists now want to learn more about the working of brains of "late-onset" blind people.

Question: A student is walking along a sidewalk at night. She hears a noise and looks in the direction of the sound. Which sense is used most often by a blind person?

People want action on noise, a recent public meeting in Brisbane showed.Some want technical improvements such as quieter air conditioners or better sound barriers around major roads.Others want tougher laws to restrict noise from building sites or to require owners to take responsibility for barking dogs.But the highest priority was a noise complaints system that works.
Brisbane City Council receives more complaints about noise than all other problems put together.So it conducted a survey and found that about half its residents are upset by noise in one form or another -traffic, mowers, pool pumps, air conditioners or loud parties.This inspired the Council to bring together more than 100 citizens one evening to talk through a range of options.
The meeting found the present regulatory system bizarre.Depending on the problem, responsibility for noise can lie with the Council, the Environment Protection Authority, one of three government departments or even the police.So complainants often feel they are getting the run-round.When the people at the forum were asked to vote for changes, the strongest response was for a 24-hour noise hotline to be the first part of call for all complaints.
The forum also favored regulatory measures, such as tougher minimum standards for noise in appliances like air conditioners.This even makes economic sense, as noise is a waste of energy and money.Other measures the meeting supported were wider buffer   zones around noisy activities and controls to keep heavy traffic away from residential areas.
But there are obvious conflicts.Many people like to have a bar within walking distance if they feel like a drink, but they don't want a noisy pub keeping them awake when they want an early night.Most people want to live near a major road providing good access to other parts of the city, but they don't' want the problem of road noise.
I was most interested by the proposals aimed at behavioral change.There was strong support for measures to reduce traffic: better public transport, cycle ways and footpaths, even charges for road use.Many people optimistically thought industry awards for better equipment would stimulate the production of quieter appliances.It was even suggested that noise from building sites could be alleviated   if Brisbane adopted daylight saving, thus shifting the working day and providing longer, quieter evenings.

Question: The city of Brisbane has a problem with noise pollution. What is the best way to reduce the noise?
Answer: move the party to another location
MC option A) move the party to another location

Kodak's decision to apply for bankruptcy protection is a sad, though not unexpected, turning point for a leading American corporation that pioneered consumer photography and dominated  the film market for decades, but finally failed to adapt to the digital revolution. 
Although many attribute Kodak's downfall to "complacency  ," that explanation doesn't admit the efforts with which the company went to reinvent itself. Decades ago, Kodak invented the first digital camera in 1975 -- but in a fateful decision, the company chose to focus on its traditional film business. 
Large companies have a difficult time switching into new markets. For example, although Kodak predicted the rise of digital photography, its culture was too rooted in the successes of the past to fully welcome the future. In the past, their history was so important to them. Now their history has become a liability. 
Kodak's downfall over the last several decades was dramatic. The 1980s brought new competition from Japanese film company Fuji Photo, which weaken Kodak by offering lower prices. Kodak's decision not to pursue the role of official film for the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics was a major loss. The bid went instead to Fuji, which exploited  its sponsorship to win a key role in the market.

Question: Kodak was the first company to produce photographic film. In the 1980s, Kodak faced competition from Fuji Photo, which offered lower-priced film. As a result of this competition, Kodak's market share declined. What is the current market share of Kodak?

Can plants eat people? Probably not, but there are many plants that eat meat. Some of them are big. And they can eat small animals. One famous meat-eating plant is the Venus flytrap .
The Venus flytrap is a very strange plant. It grows in dry parts of the United States. Its leaves are like the pages of a book. They can open and close very quickly. Inside the leaves, there are three small hairs. If a fly touches one of the hairs, the leaf closes quickly. The fly cannot get out. In about half an hour, the leaf _ the fly until it is dead. Then, the plant covers the fly. Slowly, the plant eats the fly.
Why do plants do it? Most plants get what they need from the sun, the air, and the ground. In some places, the ground is very poor. It doesn't have all these important things, especially nitrogen . Animal meat has a lot of nitrogen, so some plants eat meat to get what they need. Let's hope that some of the bigger plants don't get the same idea!

When you look up into the sky at night, have you ever felt that your eyes are playing tricks on   you? It seems that the stars are moving all the time.
Actually, there is nothing wrong with your eyes. This twinkling effect is called scintillation  . Scintillation happens because of air movements in the earth's atmosphere  . Light is "bent  " when it travels through different parts of the earth's atmosphere. As the air in the earth's atmosphere is moving all the time, the light from the stars looks as if it is moving too.
The same thing also happens to things on the ground. On a very hot and shiny day, if you look at the road, the image in the distance is not clear and things move slightly. You can also see the same effect if you drop a rock into water. The rock appears a little unclear under the moving water.
This twinkling effect causes a lot of problems for astronomers   since they cannot _ the stars clearly. A telescope   was sent into space so that the air movements in the atmosphere could be avoided  . It took a long time to build the space telescope but finally in 1990, a huge space telescope called the Hubble Space Telescope was successfully sent into space. Since then, astronomers have many important observations that have helped people understand space better.

Food is a major part of every culture. After all, everyone needs to eat! But each country has its own traditions on what people eat and when.
Egypt
Egyptians commonly start the day with a drink, sometimes going with bread. Breakfast can be eaten any time after this but before the day's main meal. In the past, this main meal was served at around 3:00 p.m. But now people work longer hours and eat when they get home at around 6:00 p.m. Dinner parties are held later, around 9:00 p.m.
Most Egyptian meals include bread or ice, cooked vegetables and beans or meat.
France
France is known for its fine cooking, and its people take food seriously. Most eat three meals a day at fixed times and never snack between meals. Breakfast is a light meal of bread and coffee. They eat lunch at around 1:00 p.m. and a dinner with multiple courses after 8:00 p.m.
The French consider eating a social activity. Eating alone is hard to see, and eating while doing something else is unheard-of. The French take time to enjoy their meals and visitors should do the same.
Brazil
Like the French, Brazilians usually eat a light breakfast. Lunch, the largest meal of the day, usually consists of meat, rice, potatoes, beans and vegetables. Between 6:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m., people enjoy a smaller meal with their families.
Brazilians don't mind eating a hurried or light meal and sometimes buy food from street carts  . But they always finish eating before walking away.
The United States
American's ancestors came from many countries, so American eating habits differ. Some take time to prepare and eat a hot breakfast. Others take a bagel   while rushing out the door or just _ . For lunch, most Americans eat a sandwich or leftovers. Traditionally, families got together for a large evening meal around 6:00, but now busy schedules force many families to eat in turns. American restaurant servings tend to be huge. But you don't have to finish them; taking leftovers home is common.

There are about 80,000,000 mines*  under the ground in more . than 60 countries. It is difficult and dangerous to clear these rnines, About 50  people including many children were' killed 'or htirt each iay.  In 2003,  APOPO,  a Dutch research com pan y that uains the an imals, came up with the-idea of s\ng rats to search for the mines.
The animal trainers 'found that a kind of rats from Africa were clever and had.a sharp*  sense of smell.  The rats were about 75 cm long and.weighed about l.35 kg, light enough to run across a minefield without setting off the mines.
In January 2004, the APOPO started this project. First, the trainers let the 4-week-old baby rats get familiar with humans. A few weeks later, the rats were no Ionger afraid of people and 'the things around them. Then they were trained to connect a click* sound with food. After the rats had leamed that, the trainers then taught them to tell the difference between the smell of mines and other smells. When the rats could do it, the click was sounded and they were given a bit of banana.  The method was called clicker training. "The training isn't easy, said trainer Abdullah Mchomvu.  "You have to be patient. Sometimes I get angry, but then again, I tell myself these are animals."
After nine months'training, the rats were taken to a minefield. They'ran across the minefield, stopped, sat and scratched the ground to tell the deminers*  that they smelt out'a mine.  Then the mine was cleared. It had  taken two 'deminers  a day to clear a 200m2 . minefield, but with the help of two rats 'they could finish it in two hours.
The rats and the deminers saved thousands of lives, "The rats did this job much better than we expected. So far they have helped to make almost 2,000,000m2 of land safe. They are heroes," said Bart Weeqens, the head of the APOPO.

"Depend on yourself" is what nature says to every man. Parents can help you. Teachers can help you. Others still can help you. But all these people only help you to help yourself.
There have been many great men in history. Many of them were very poor when they were young, and had no uncles, aunts, or friends to help them. Schools were few and not very good. They could not depend on them for education. They tried their best to learn something and never gave up till they became well-known. One of the most famous teachers in England used to tell his pupils, "I cannot make worthy men of you, but I can help you make men of yourselves."
Some young men don't try their best to make themselves valuable to the human beings. If they see their weak points and change their ways, they can be successful. They are nothing now, and will be nothing as long as  they live, unless they accept the advice of their parents and teachers, and depend on themselves.

Snack time is a part of the day for children of all ages. But new research suggests that kids snacking in big groups could be at risk for _ .
Scientists from American University looked at the eating behavior of 54 kids between the ages of 2 and 6. At snack time, the scientist watched the amount of food each child ate while they were in groups of either three or nine. According to the study, the more children there are in a group, the more likely they are to eat more. Those in the larger group ate nearly 30 percent more than those in the smaller group, and they actually ate faster.
Since this is the first such study in children, scientists are quick to point out the importance of encouraging healthy habits in kids as early as possible.
"If you know kids eat more in large groups, it seems perfect to use this information to keep snack groups small or use small tables," says Dr. Jana Klauer, an expert in New York.
Smaller groups would allow for a quiet and more relaxing environment-a perfect chance to teach children about food, manners and how to know when they feel full. "This would have an effect on kids' eating," adds Klauer. "They would slow down and eat less."

To all be on the same page for human evaluation, I have a detailed outline of each metric.

All based on https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.06106.pdf and https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.08648.pdf.

Question
- Fluency: whether the question is grammatical and fluent.
- Relevancy: whether the question is semantic relevant to the passage.
- Answerability: whether the question can be answered by the right answer.

Answer:
- Fluency: whether the answer is grammatical and fluent.
- Correctness: whether the answer contains correct information.
- Valid: whether the answer is a correct answer to the question.

Distractors:
- Fluency: whether the distractors are grammatical and fluent.
- Coherence: whether the distractors are relevant to the article and the question.
- Distracting Ability: whether the distractors can mislead the learner. Once there is true information in the distractors -> set this metric to 0.
